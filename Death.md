# Beyond Death

## What Happens When You Die? 

When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature didn’t worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment.


### What Really Happens?

To begin with, all mortal creatures are granted life by the One Who Is Hidden. When the spirit or the breath of life leaves the flesh, the mortal body dies. 


## The Astral Rift

The “soul” of a creature, its memories, personality and ultimately, alignment moves on to the Astral Plane, where outsiders fight over the disembodied prize. The soul's deity or alignment will establish an initial trajectory, but the ultimate destination depends on which outsider captures the soul.

Outsiders are broadly categorized as celestials (good), fiends (evil) and elementals (neutral). 

Celestials grant souls entrance to the heavens, the upper planes, while fiends devour the soul or dominate and torture them. Elementals largely don’t participate in the war over or trade of souls.

## Celestials

Souls entering the upper planes are sorted by axis of order, while the moral axis is refined by holy fire. If the soul was dedicated to evil, it enters the heavens much as a child enters the mortal world. Whatever remains of the soul is free to thrive in Celestia (LG), Elysium (NG) or Arborea (CG). While celestials may be of any good alignment, typically angels and archons are lawful good, guardinals are neutral good and celestial eladrin are chaotic good.

## Fiends

Tanar'ri, spawn of the Abyss, are chaotic evil demons, unpredictable engines of destruction, lacking all compassion, empathy and mercy. Baatezu, once mortals, now condemned to Baator are are lawful evil devils, tyrannical, and torturous, dedicated to the domination of mortal life, crafty negotiators of pacts, obedient servitors of evil. Yugoloths, daemons spawned on the Gray Wastes are neutral evil fiends of malevolent intent and mercenary mindset, notorious for shifting loyalties, embodiments of avarice.

Souls taken by the demons are destroyed while those captured by the devils are brought to the nine hells for torment and servitude. Yugoloths seek to trade souls so often oppose demons and trade with devils. All demonstrate high commitment in the Astral plane, as they are protected from death, though not entirely from consequence (see below). 

## The Blood War

Fortunately for souls, this perpetual war over souls starts in Avernus, where devils seek to close the Blood Rift, the passage from the Abyss that leads to the Blood River of Avernus, and prevent demons from taking the Rift to the Astral plane. Devils value souls while demons merely seek to destroy them. This creates a tenuous alliance in shared purpose between the celestials and the Baatezu. 

## Outsider Death

Angels are immortal and cannot be permanently killed anywhere. When killed in their home plane, they remain an essence of holy energy for days or weeks before returning to their physical form. When killed in the lower planes, however, they rise as a fiend. 

Fiends face true annihilation when slain on their home plane, but even elsewhere, death has consequences. If destroyed outside their native plane, they reform in their home plane at a cost. This demotion often strips away much of their power and individuality, reducing them to a primordial state that may take weeks, months or even years to rebuild. The mightier the outsider, the less they are diminished, but the loss is never trivial.

Demons are returned as a primordial ooze used to form new demons. Devils are returned intact, but require time to reform and may face demotion. Yugoloths, similar to demons, are returned to their home planes as an essence of pure evil, an ichor used to spawn new yugoloths. 

Fiends killed in their home plane die, unless they have risen to demon or yugoloth lord or arch devil status, where they are immortal. When an immortal fiend is killed in its home plane, it may take years to reform, and this nearly always means usurpation. A demon or yugoloth lord or arch devil may be killed by another of its kind in its home plane.

Hell lacks the power of creation found in the upper planes, relying on recycling its denizens or corrupting souls to fuel its armies. This weakness gives demons an advantage in the Blood War, as they primarily battle outside their home plane. For devils, every loss in the Blood Rift of Avernus risks annihilation, forcing them to pursue mortal souls to replenish their ranks.

## The Soul Trade

While the celestials have the upper hand in the Astral Rift, due to strength and numbers, many fiends capture souls before they enter the Astral plane. 

Some night hags carry a Soul Bag, trapping souls by killing them outright or performing rituals to acquire them, transforming them into larvae or soul worms, allowing them to trade the souls in the lower planes. 

Devils use Faustian bargains to trade wealth or material benefits for the souls of mortals. Mortals who make these pacts are visibly marked when they reach the Astral plane. Celestials must pay a price or forfeit the soul. 

Once a soul is transferred to a devil, it may be pressed into immediate service or torment, or be minted into a soul coin, a convenient currency used in the Nine Hells that carries the essence of the soul itself. 

## Celestial Redemption

Celestials have been known to redeem souls from Hell, but at a cost. They may perform costly rescue missions, negotiate or bargain for souls or use divine relics to free souls from bondage. They may even pay the highest price - trading mortal souls for the souls or service of the celestials themselves. Many devil legions are accompanied by bound angelic hosts.
