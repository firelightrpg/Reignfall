The players met in the marketplace of Daggerford. Hinan was recovering from some wounds, moving from a house in the eastern shanties toward the smiths on Tanner Way. Steward and Rick were working at a consignment stall. Eg, Theren and Mara were perusing the markets, with Eg seeking out woolen cloaks. 

After some introductions, a fairy was noticed sizing up the party, evaluating whether they might be able to assist her. She approached Mara and introduced herself. 

*I have noticed that the trees are dying, the animals are becoming more aggressive, and the air is filled with a sense of dread. I believe that something is corrupting the forest, and I fear for its future.*

*I have come to you because I saw your focus. I believe that you have the strength and courage to restore balance to the forest.*

She then gave Mara a crumpled map, with bones marking the blighted Blackbranch forest, north of Stillwater. 

The party traveled out toward Blackbranch, moving through Stillwater, where they discovered Ambergul houseguards attempting to abscond with young farm children, ostensibly to press them into service of the Ambergul Estates. 

The team quickly sprang into action, murdering one houseguard with a fire bolt and injuring the others as they backed down without their prize, one guard short and one pierced with arrows.

The farmers expressed their gratitude and relayed the story of a traderâ€™s cog that stopped along the Delimbiyr to harvest mushrooms in the Blackbranch forest. Several were taken and the few that managed to escape fled without their companions.
