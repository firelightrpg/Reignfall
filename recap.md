## Session 1 
### Poisoned Skies - Darkening of the Wood
2023-07-07

The players met in the marketplace of Daggerford. Hinan was recovering from some wounds, moving from a house in the eastern shanties toward the smiths on Tanner Way. Steward and Rick were working at a consignment stall. Eg, Theren and Mara were perusing the markets, with Eg seeking out woolen cloaks. 

After some introductions, a fairy was noticed sizing up the party, evaluating whether they might be able to assist her. She approached Mara and introduced herself. 

*I have noticed that the trees are dying, the animals are becoming more aggressive, and the air is filled with a sense of dread. I believe that something is corrupting the forest, and I fear for its future.*

*I have come to you because I saw your focus. I believe that you have the strength and courage to restore balance to the forest.*

She then gave Mara a crumpled map, with bones marking the blighted Blackbranch forest, north of Stillwater. 

The party traveled out toward Blackbranch, moving through Stillwater, where they discovered Ambergul houseguards attempting to abscond with young farm children, ostensibly to press them into service of the Ambergul Estates. 

The team quickly sprang into action, murdering one houseguard with a fire bolt and injuring the others as they backed down without their prize, one guard short and one pierced with arrows.

The farmers expressed their gratitude and relayed the story of a trader’s cog that stopped along the Delimbiyr to harvest mushrooms in the Blackbranch forest. Several were taken and the few that managed to escape fled without their companions.

The family hosted the defenders for the night, and planned to change residences to avoid the wrath of any returning houseguards. 

During the night, some of the party began experiencing vivid and unsettling dreams, filled with spiderwebs, eerie whispers, and a sense of impending doom. 

Continuing into the forest, some had vivid and unsettling dreams of spiderwebs, eerie whispers, and a sense of impending doom.

The forest became darker and the atmosphere took on an eerie and foreboding quality. The trees became gnarled and twisted, their branches interlaced with thick cobwebs that stretch from trunk to trunk like a sinister tapestry, reinforcing the fairy’s cautions and the recent nightmares. 

After moving toward a webbed clearing, the company managed to get the drop on the arachnids, achieving surprise by Mara drawing them out with a mage hand plucking a nearby web, with knowledge from Theren’s familiar terrain. 

What could have been a dangerous encounter was defeated without 
injury. 

What lies ahead? <cue dramatic music>

The farmers relayed the traders name is Cara and she is a Sword Coast trader tha usually works the Delimbiyr River trade route. She is an accomplished navigator and knowledgeable merchant. 

Cara is a young woman with short, dark hair and piercing brown eyes. She is of average height and build, with a wiry strength that comes from years of traveling the Sword Coast. She is often dressed in simple, practical clothing, but she always wears a silver necklace with a pendant of a wolf's head.

    She has a tattoo of a wolf's paw on her left forearm.
    She has a scar on her right cheek from a bear attack.
    She has a silver earring in her right ear.

Her crew has been asking around and offering a reward for her safe return.

## Session 2
### Poisoned Skies - Darkening of the Wood
2023-07-26

The players continued following the lead given to Mara by the fairy in the market and headed into the Blackbranch forest. 

The fairy (who mysteriously neglected to give her name) seeks the aid of the players, sharing her concerns about the deteriorating state of the forest. She suspects dark magic at work and asks the players to investigate the cause and restore balance to the forest.

The once lush and peaceful forest Blackbranch has been slowly turning into a dark and foreboding place. 

Further, the family the players assisted in Stillwater mentioned several traders from an oared cog with goods destined for Waterdeep have gone missing while venturing into Blackbranch to forage mushrooms after mooring their cog, leaving behind only shredded clothes and signs of a struggle.

After defeating the initial group of spiders, apparently on the prowl, the party ventured further. 

As you emerged into a clearing, an eerie sight unfolded before you. The ground is carpeted with a thick layer of webs, spun intricately between the surrounding trees and across the clearing like a gossamer veil.

In the center of the clearing, a once-majestic tree stands, now decayed and hollowed out, its bark worn and weathered. The tree's skeletal branches reach out like twisted arms, adorned with a macabre display. From its gnarled branches, desiccated humanoids are suspended, their bodies wrapped tightly in silken cocoons of spider webs. The victims' features are obscured by the webbing, their forms suspended in a grotesque dance of death. Some are left to dangle freely, while others have been carefully placed within the hollowed trunk, their lifeless forms arranged with unsettling precision.

The party fought another group of spiders, one of which could phase in and out of seeming existence. 

After defeating those spiders, you followed the spiders' trail until you emerged from dense foliage, and spotted three cave entrances scattered along the hillside. The right entrance is a sinkhole going down in a series of 5-6 foot dirt embankments to a rough hole leading down. It appears as a dark maw within the rocky outcrop with jagged edges and a narrow opening.

You opted for the narrow cleft between two rocks, about 15' up the hillside. 

The party lit a spider web on fire, that attracted two spider swarms, a handful of smaller spiders and an unsettling spider shepherd with features both human and arachnid. 

What lies ahead?

## Session 3
### Poisoned Skies - Darkening of the Wood
2023-08-09

After delving further into the spiders' underground lair, on the upper west side of the cavern is a collection of cocooned bodies, bones and refuse, demonstrating these spiders answer nature’s call where they feed. Upon inspection, one of the bodies wears a pendant adorned with a stylized dragon symbol. Amongst the refuse are the remains of several used poison kits. 

The party then explored the main multi-tiered cavern, with a high ledge on the left side that is over 40 feet above the floor level of the cave, and the each tier on the north side of the cave being roughly 7-9 feet above the tier before it.

On the very highest of the east ledges, among the recently gnawed remnants of a human corpse is a web-cocooned humanoid. If freed, Cara is poisoned, but alive. With nurture she regained consciousness after one hour, and wanted to look for her fellow traders, however, all of which are dead. 

Amongst the treasure the spiders have accumulated are the remains of several used poison kits. 

After parlaying with the clutter queen, trading her life for the coccon, the party also picked up a decorative scroll case. with what appears to be a locking mechanism adorned with dragons. On closer inspection, it appears to have a rotating dial, several glyphs, a relief of three dragons, elven runes and radiates abjuration and necromancy magic. The relief shows three encircled fighting dragons, a gold dragon attacking an indeterminate color dragon, which, in turn is attacking a red dragon, which in turn is attacking the gold dragon.  After opening the scroll case, two scrolls, Revivify and Mass Healing Word were discovered. 

The party headed back toward Daggerford, and everyone gained a level (2). On the way back, they tussled with another group of nobles who were in the process of summary execution, again, of a young adult if not a child.

## Session 4
### Poisoned Skies - Temple of the Snake God
2023-08-18

The party returned returned Hallis, the young adult rescued from the Liam's Hold Retinue, to his home in the outlying farms of Daggerford and headed into the city proper, with an eye out for the wanted posters. 

Some of the party went to the Black Stone Inn for some refreshements where they discovered a broken man, Alistair, who's faithful hunting dog Jax had been killed by misshapen, large bandits and was drowning his sorrows in drink. The party escorted Alistair safely to the barracks, where he spent the night.

After which, everyone ate and had a restful night, some at the Black Stone Inn, and others with Theren at his father's house.

The next morning, the party returned to the barracks to speak with Alistair and also met Serwyn, a Daggerford guard who mentioned Haldur, a seasoned and weathered trader who was also a collector, and has been searching for a Serpent Talisman, rumored to be near Blackhelm Tower. 

The party investigated and discovered a weathered lump of rock, seeming a natural formation at first. On closer inspection, you notice the faint remnants of a once-impressive statue. Carved from stone long ago, the statue now appears worn and aged, blending seamlessly with the surrounding rocks and vegetation.

The stone figure stands tall, its form distorted and weathered by the passage of time. Its shape suggests a powerful creature, with elongated limbs and a coiled body. The surface is covered in patches of moss and lichen, further camouflaging its true nature. Though its original details have faded, you can still discern hints of intricate carvings that once adorned its surface, hinting at the artistry that went into its creation.

After which, Theren noticed some footsteps and climbed the ridge to see a peculiar sight, a sturdy, elevated platform supported by a hulking creature. The platform is constructed from rough-hewn planks and lashed together with thick ropes and animal hide bindings. It provides ample space for four small individuals to stand or sit, each equipped with weapons and gear. The makeshift structure is fortified with barricades of stacked shields and salvaged materials, forming a protective barrier around the riders. Atop the platform, you see a collection of crates, barrels, and sacks secured tightly to prevent them from shifting during movement. The entire contraption sways with the creature's heavy footsteps, revealing its improvised nature. The riders, clad in mismatched armor and wielding a variety of weapons, maintain a vigilant watch, their eyes scanning the surroundings for any signs of danger.

Near the ogre's death, after killing or routing the goblins and bloodying the ogre, the ogre blew a horn. 

Out of the ruins of a nearby tower came two more large creatures, one wielding a massive ballista. After a somewhat grueling battle, the party sheltered in the ruined tower for a much needed rest.

## Session 5
### Poisoned Skies - Temple of the Snake God
2023-09-21

The party entered the structure under the tower after resting at the ground level. It was clear the ruins were only recently occupied by the ogre-kin, and the previous inhabitants had perished long ago, due to a cataclysmic event, leveling the structure above ground and sealing it's inhabitants to suffer slow and agonizing deaths. 

The party investigated the structure, defeated several ogres, rescued hostages and discovered a chamber with ritual wards for a serpent talisman. The item was retrieved successfully by following the rituals depicted in the murals.

The party also befriended a giant boar, serving the ogres. 

## Session 6
### Poisoned Skies - Interim
2023-10-12

The party returned the hostages, Rhys, an influential trader, from house Merriweather, Eira Rivenwood, an herbalist and mother figure to the other hostages, Gwenneth, a teenage girl with surprising resilience,  who the ogre leader attempted to use as human shield, Aldric, a hunter from Daggerford and Eldra, a botanist determined to escape.

 After returning the rescued folk to their various places around the Delimbyr vale, the party encountered a distressed rancher, Fineas, suspicious of wolves after losing livestock, and a sage named Emyr, overly excited about the prospect of a long lost fort, and discovering it's secrets. 

The party set up watch at Fineas' ranch, and discovered some poisoned plants. Theren used his Primeval Awareness and detected aberrations, dragons, fey, fiends and undead within range. 

After un uneventful evening, the party elected to follow Emyr's direction and headed to the region between the Blackbranch and Blightwood forests.

## Session 7
### Poisoned Skies - Grimhold
2023-10-20

After un uneventful evening setting up watch at Fineas' farm, the party elected to follow Emyr's direction and headed to the region between the Blackbranch and Blightwood forests.

Along the way, the party encountered Barricade, a halfling Circle of the Moon Druid, examining a pig. After being a bit perturbed by the party's presence running off the pig, introductions were had. After discussing the party's recent events and determining common purpose, Barricade decided to join them on their journey to the ruined fort. 

On the way, Therin detected all manner of tracks, but in particular, wolf, a large monstrous wolf and something else, even more strange than the large monstrous wolves, but of similar size and nature. The wolf tracks seemed mundane, and not coming or going from any particular direction. However, the other large wolf-like tracks seemed to be coming and going in the direction of the ruined fort. 

Upon approach, the party came upon the crumbling remains of a once-mighty fortress looming before them, silhouetted against the sky. The weathered stone walls rise jaggedly, their surfaces marred by the ravages of time and neglect. The roofs have collapsed and much of the structure is exposed to the elements.

The party continued toward the fort, approaching in daylight, but using the stepped nature of the hill to approach from cover. After getting about half way up the hill, a large worg and goblin rider came out of the main entrance, 

At least one of the large wolf like creatures, now demystified did not notice the party at first, but the keen-eyed goblin spotted the starry formed tortle and directed his mount toward Eg. The party had delayed prepared attacks, hoping to stay undetected, but unleashed hell on the lone rider and his mount.

The party then approached the  southeast tower of the fort with an upper entrance, now nothing more than a hole in the wall, with signs it once had a staircase. After carefully peering in, they discovered more goblins, and a larger, somewhat fiendish looking goblin were eating and playing dice, not particularly alert as sentries. 

Barricade turned into a spider and began to scout the area. He managed to scout the lower level of the tower, where three hobgoblins were sleeping and eating and managed to skulk into the central ward of the keep, where he found the floor collapsed to a natural cave beneath the keep with a pool of water, presumably formed from exposure to the elements. 

After returning and conveying this information to the rest of the party, they came back around to the entrance on the main level. While attempting to decide on a course of action, another goblin rider and a lone goblin exited the fort. Another battle ensued and with precision, marksmanship and a bear, they were quickly dispatched. 

The party continued into the keep, first scouting out the upper level of the southwest tower and continuing in to the inner ward. Three hobgoblins emerged from the main level of the southeast tower. Steward, still disguised as a hobgoblin, attempted to lure them to the caves beneath the fort. He succeeded, but was discovered and a battle ensued. The hobgoblins and their captain were defeated, but not without expending some precious resources...

The first goblin that was killed had a satchel with some disgusting food and a letter of correspondence between the goblins. They mentioned allowing plundered stores to rot, making them far more delectable, filled with maggots... The letter also mentioned receiving spider poison, but did not elucidate on who from. The goblins also seem to be missing some patrols, but it was unclear as to why. After one such missing patrol had left, Grimgore, perhaps their leader, was seen leaving the fort.

## Session 8
### Poisoned Skies - Grimhold
2023-11-14

The party continued to explore the ruined keep, entering the inner ward where they got the jump on the hobgoblins in main floor of the southeast tower. 
---Note
It was questioned why the party did not get surprise. I mentioned you weren't all hiding but wanted to explain a bit further here. Usually, this means you are hiding. While the inner ward was brightly lit (which obviates hiding without cover), there was plenty of cover (total cover guarantees success, half cover grants a Stealth check). However, in order to have line of sight for an attack, Therin and was directly in line with the door.  In order to achieve surprise, an enemy must not notice any threat - meaning, even noticing one party member spoils surprise. If you all make Stealth checks, only the lowest roll matters, with respect to surprise. However, many of you did achieve attacking as an unseen attacker for your first attack. Surprise and being an unseen attacker are related, but you can have both or one without the other, depending on circumstances. You can also have one or more enemies that are surprised while others are not. 

To be fair, upon reflection, I should have probably still had at least the first hobgoblin be surprised, because the enemy did not expect anyone to be in the inner ward and at the point they opened the door, everyone was behind total cover. 
---
After a tough battle with the hobgoblins, the party proceeded into the northwest tower, where they fought a mixed group of goblins, hobgoblins and a bugbear. 

The party then proceeded into the caves below the complex where they fought hobgoblins, a bugbear and Grimgore, a fearsome goblin that transformed into a horrifying and twisted hybrid of wolf and goblin. 

The barghest Grimgore moved around the tunnels to avoid being seen by the goblinoids while using its powerful form.

After defeating the rest of the goblinoids and Grimgore, the session ended. 

Are there lingering golbinoids in the keep? What was in the journal? What about the northeast tower?

Just a reminder - if you see a journal, runes, a scroll or any form of writing, the DM is likely trying to communicate information to you :slight_smile:

Another reminder - don't forget the short rests! Unless one combat bleeds into another, or there are sentries on patrol, you generally can take a short rest once you've secured your current location.

## Session 9
### Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker - _The Mountain Door_
2023-11-17

The party finished searching Grimhold, the dwarven keep previously inhabited by goblinoids lead by a barghest and headed back to Daggerford, where they were greeted as heroes by Captain Arayndar Delimbiyr. In response to your many accomplishments, and the ongoing troubles with the nobles, the captain requested you attend a council of nobles, being held at Anteos Manner.

After a day spent resupplying and some  etiquette training from Steward, Theren headed to his family's residence and the rest retired in a room at the River Shining. Early in the morning, loud noises awoke everyone and it turned out to be the barkeep punching out a petty thug with overblown ideas of being a hit man. He had a flyer from one of the noble houses with a reward that had gone up significantly since the last one you all saw.

The party then regrouped with Theren and headed to Anteos Manor after hiring a horse, carriage and rider. Arriving in style, the party was met by both sneers and many thanks from the various attendants. After a feast, just before Lady Bronwyn Daggerford was about to make some announcements, terrible screams were heard outside, followed by shouts of "Dragon!".

While most were diving under tables or fleeing to rooms without windows, the party viewed the destruction through the grand windows, where many lie dead and much of the structure was eaten away from the corrosive breath of the dragon. Captain Arayndar Delimbiyr (possibly pronounced "uh reindeer"), shouted, "to the roof!" and the party followed, along with a few brave soldiers of Daggerford.

But, as you arrived on the roof, you only got a glimpse of the dragon as it flew away east. It was without doubt, a black dragon, likely of the "Young" variety.

Captain Arayndar discussed with the party a local cutpurse, Nelix, pitied by Sergeant Delphine after arresting her. Nelix told the Sergeant she had been following a group of suspicious zealots, thinking them a possible mark. She overheard them mention Theraldur, an ancient Dwarf-hold in the Lizard Marshes thought lost to the ravages of time. The Captain didn't think much of it, but did some research anyway, and discovered a map to the ancient fortress. He thrust in into the party's hands with hearty "Good luck!"

Before heading down the stairs, Lady Bronwyn approached Theren,  bravely holding back tears, grabbed his arm and offered him three black feathered arrows. Unable to speak, she simply nodded. It was later determined one was magical, an Arrow of Slaying Black Dragons.

The party headed into the Marsh. Whether due to the eeriness of the swamp or the recent shadow of the dragon, your journey was unchallenged.

A path meandered up a switchback, rising out of the swamp toward a bare shoulder of rock. Two lizardfolk were found to be unattentively guarding the entrance. After killing one, the other fled into the complex. Barricade took up chase, only to be targeted from cleverly disguised murder holes. Eg followed close behind while Theren and Steward hung back.

Barricade was able to see a chamber with a narrow ledge overlooking a deep, dark crevasse that cuts the room in two. A dangerous-looking rope bridge, frayed and thin, spans the gap. Water gurgles and rushes somewhere far below.

Explored so far...

## Session 10
### Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker - _The Mountain Door_
2023-12-07

(*Steward*)
We pushed our way deeper inside the cave, taking out several lizardmen along the way to a rope bridge.

After we cross the bridge, we enter a space filled with old dwarven furniture and a cage. In the caged area are two captives: Garrett,  human from farming settlement, Union. Neelix, Elf lady with daggers. After we freed them, the man left after we gave him a weapon. Nelix stayed with us.
We were told Ixira is the name of the acid dragon.

Nelix told us the cave was made by the Dwarf clan Forgespire. They built Theroldor(?) to defend against enemy menaces and work with the Bronze Dragon Zephira. They left the outpost open to attack and bronze dragon was killed.

Party went ahead and encountered Lizard Queen and her attendants. Crazy battle ensued. Nelix helped take out the baddies.

Afterwards, Nelix told us how she was a cutpurse who ended up finding and raising the last egg of the bronze dragon and is here to kill the acid dragon.

## Session 11
### Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker _Glitterhame_
2023-12-26

After defeating the lizardfolk queen, the party descended to the Glitterhame, the former mines for the Forgespire dwarves, a large series of natural caverns in the heart of the Theraldur.

After examining carefully several dwarven sarcophagi and leaving them unlooted, the party encountered a roper and it's piercer children guarding the Dwarf Door. 

The party found a key that opened the door on a mold covered skeleton and secured the area for a much needed rest.

Beyond the door was a long stair leading to a room with dwarven statues, but it was only briefly examined for enemies and left for after the rest.

## Session 12
### Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker _The Foundry_
2024-01-16

#### Chamber of Statues
After a much needed rest, the party entered the octagonal chamber, with three large statues and and two northern doors between them. After some brief investigation, it was discovered there was a secret door to the east and likely that opening either of the northern doors would trigger the statues to attack. Further investigation revealed they were in fact false doors. The party traveled through the secret door, up a staircase, where a pressure plate triggered a magic mouth in the relief of a dwarf's head in the eastern door at the top of the stairs to shout out a warning. 

#### The Great hall
The party proceeded to enter a large, well lit hall with columns spanning west to east, with a dais on the eastern end and a small campsite in front of it. Quickly it was determined that several lizadfolk cultists were waiting behind the columns to ambush the party. Several were initiates but two were dragonclaw spellcasters.

#### The Foundry
After defeating the lizardfolk in the great hall, the party entered the foundry to the south, where several initiates were attempting to forge a blade. Steward, posing as a lizardfolk drew them into the Great Hall, where they were quickly dispatched. A cavern to the east was discovered that lead to a great chasm with a chain ladder. It was decided that they should continue clearing this level before descending. 

#### Courtyard and Commons
An ancient battle space was discovered, where many dwarves and a great many more lizardfolk lost their lives. The dwarven courtyard and commons area was littered with corpses. 

#### Desecrated Shrine
To the west, a shrine was discovered. Eg used detect magic and determined the presence of abjuration at the altar and at least three sources of necromancy nearby. The party decided to save this for later.

#### Horin's Quarters and Council Chamber
After encircling the eastern portion of the foundry, the party discovered a secret exit from Horin's quarters, the famed leader and great smith of the dwarven enclave. The area was now housing the cult's leader, Nimira, a powerful lizardfolk dragonfang. She was surprised sleeping, out of her armor, so the party chose to take the initiative. During the fight, her first lieutenant, Varak, a dragonwing wielding a greataxe entered the fight from the Council Chamber to the east. Steward tricked Varak into running back into the Council Chamber with a minor illusion, but Varak's loyalty to Nimira brought him back. After the party defeated the two, they discovered a satchel with the Dawnbreaker manifesto. 

*The Dawnbreakers are a faction of the Keepers of the Sacred Horn, known as the Horns of the Black Beast, or simply, Dawnbreakers. As with other Cult of the Dragon followers, they venerate dragons, especially undead dragons. The Dawnbreakers are devoted to Ixira, raising her in life to at least 100 years (she is in her late 90s), then with the intention of performing the rituals to elevate her to dracolich status. A special black sapphire talisman has been designated as her phylactery. They are fully committed devotees, working with any allies they deem useful, mentioning specifically the goblins of Grimhold, the giants of Vith Rah (Temple of the Snake God), the spider clutter of Blackbranch as well as are several noble houses of Daggerford, though they appear to be in some form of code, as the names are draconic for “feathered house”, “black house” and several lumped in as “houses of gluttony”.*

*Namira and her captain*

## Session 13
### Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker _The Black Lake_
2024-01-16

(*Lulu*)
Theren made an abrupt departure for home due to his father’s failing health, promising to be ready if any attacks befall Daggerford.  He hurriedly hands the 3 arrows and the potion of greater healing to Nelix and is gone.  Nelix then reveals her true identity (LuLu) to the group, indicating she was hired by an unknown party from Daggerford to investigate the misfortunes befalling the area, to see if they are related to the supposed cultists and to determine if there is any involvement from any of the Daggerford nobles.  Yes to all.  The party doubles down on their commitment to finding and defeating the dragon, Ixira.

With the help of Garrett, the other freed captive (from session 10), the party returns to the desiccated shrine room and eliminates the last 3 undead Dawnbreakers.  They find a pouch of 600 gp, a bone scroll case with a scroll of web and a scroll of spider climb and are gifted a tablet by Horin’s freed spirit.  Confident they’ve cleared this floor of the ruins, they head to the chain ladder and descend into the caverns underneath Theraldur.

After scouting a bit and a few minutes of well-executed mending on the bridge, the party finds their quarry:  Ixira rests on an island in a small (but deep) lake.  They prepare for battle as the dragon slips below the surface, only to emerge much closer and ready for a fight.  They trade blows, Ixira dealing far more damage than she took, at one point knocking Barricade out.  But with a few lucky shots, some spells, a lot of healing, the use of Horin’s tablet, and the arrival of the bronze dragon wyrmling, Telarion, the last of Theren’s 3 magic arrows provided the final blow to the big black dragon. (whew!)

Treasure was collected and the party got the heck outta Dodge.

## Session 14
### Weald of Woe - _Whispers by the Sea_
2024-02-15

*The cylinder contains a parchment with secret orders, written in Aragrakh, an ancient dialect of draconic. 
The orders, dated several days ago, direct followers from house Ambergul, Halyndliam and Cromm, to head north to Leilon. Daggerford has become aware of their efforts and Ixira has been slain. Leilon is rebuilding and still weak enough not to oppose them and there are many allies in the region, including the Dreadscale Disciples (evidently another sect of the Keepers of the Sacred Horn), who have been working in Leilon for months. 
Alicia, consort of Kord Reynard Ambergul was kidnapped and taken to house Shahid. 
The last line reads, Focus efforts on preparing Alicia and assisting the Dreadscale Disciples.*

*Yellowcrest Manor stands on Delzorin Street, between Vhezoar Street and Brondar’s Way in Waterdeep's North Ward.*
*Lord Viallis and Lady Maria had two sons, Malik and Janus, and one daughter, Tianna.*
*The family owned several tanneries and shoemaking shops in Waterdeep, but most of its wealth was inherited on Maria's side.*
*Lord Viallis' closest business associate was a half-drow named Faerl, who visited Lord Viallis twice a tenday.*

(*Mara*)
The party journeyed north offering their 'escort services' to [some NPC] headed to Waterdeep. This gave them an opportunity to turn a trip they were going to make anyway into one that also paid. The journey took 7 days, and Leilon (their ultimate destination) lay another 10 days out, but an interesting opportunity presented itself to address first in Waterdeep.

(*Lulu*)
_From LuLu’s Journal_
Entry #72:
Wow what a few days it’s been.  So glad that dragon’s gone.  We got some nice loot too.  I REALLY wanted to collect some of that acid, but we couldn’t make it work.  I like my new bow, though – dwarven made!
We left Theraldur (I can imagine what a great place it was in it’s heyday!) and headed back to Daggerford to report our activities and findings (that “manifesto” was going to help) when we were ambushed (sorry Ada.)  There were some more cultists who attacked.  Thankfully, there were 2 more people sent from Daggerforld to help out in the cultist hunt who showed up and helped us defeat them.  Reichart and Padrick were actually pretty awesome. We kept one cultist alive for questioning, and I got a bit overzealous (as usual).  I think I scared Pad a little (maybe Eg too to be honest.)  I need to tone it down.  We learned about some future plans by the cultists – they even had some secret orders in ANCIENT Draconic, which of course, Steward knew.  It named the Daggerford Houses involved, and new plans changing focus to the north in Leilon.
We turned our captive in to authorities in Daggerford and presented our information to Lady Daggerford.  She was very intrigued by the mention of Leilon and filled us in on some details, and seemed very curious about the Keepers of the Sacred Horn.  Again, overzealous me became suspicious of her ability to speak (sort of) ancient draconic.  I mean, we ARE hunting dragon cultists.
Then we went shopping with our new friends.  And yes, you're right Mom, sometimes you do make friends quickly when adventuring.  I wonder if Barricade has figured out yet that Pad isn’t using Druid magic to change into a hare.
More later. 
Entry #73
We took a small job escorting a caravan of goods to Waterdeep (since we needed to go that direction anyway.)  Uneventful.  Except when we came across a large tree blocking the road.  Guess who got overzealous again, thinking it was another ambush?  We actually got rewarded by some Waterdeep guards with some really nice wine for moving the tree out of the way.
Oh yeah.  Before we made it all the way to Waterdeep, we actually ran into a spirit.  Crazy.  Barricade (that dude fears nothing) let it possess him.  We found out she was Sarah, a servant of a Waterdeep family who had witnessed some pretty scary things: ritual casting, rune circles, a tome bearing an image of a monster, and the murder of the whole family and their house (Yellowcrest Manor).  I think everyone wants to investigate when we get to WD and maybe see if we can help Sarah and the rest of the poor trapped souls.
Although we do have a cult to stop.  More later

*In her distressed rants, the poor servant's spirit to reveals this information:*
*- Yellowcrest Manor stands on Delzorin Street, between Vhezoar Street and Brondar’s Way in Waterdeep's North Ward.*
*- Lord Viallis and Lady Maria had two sons, Malik and Janus, and one daughter, Tianna.*
*- The family owned several tanneries and shoemaking shops in Waterdeep, but most of its wealth was inherited on Maria's side.*
*- Lord Viallis' closest business associate was an elf named Faerl, who visited Lord Viallis twice a tenday.*
