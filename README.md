# Session 1 - _Poisoned Skies - Darkening of the Wood_
2023-07-07

The players met in the marketplace of Daggerford. Hinan was recovering from some wounds, moving from a house in the eastern shanties toward the smiths on Tanner Way. Steward and Rick were working at a consignment stall. Eg, Theren and Mara were perusing the markets, with Eg seeking out woolen cloaks. 

After some introductions, a fairy was noticed sizing up the party, evaluating whether they might be able to assist her. She approached Mara and introduced herself. 

*I have noticed that the trees are dying, the animals are becoming more aggressive, and the air is filled with a sense of dread. I believe that something is corrupting the forest, and I fear for its future.*

*I have come to you because I saw your focus. I believe that you have the strength and courage to restore balance to the forest.*

She then gave Mara a crumpled map, with bones marking the blighted Blackbranch forest, north of Stillwater. 

The party traveled out toward Blackbranch, moving through Stillwater, where they discovered Ambergul houseguards attempting to abscond with young farm children, ostensibly to press them into service of the Ambergul Estates. 

The team quickly sprang into action, murdering one houseguard with a fire bolt and injuring the others as they backed down without their prize, one guard short and one pierced with arrows.

The farmers expressed their gratitude and relayed the story of a trader’s cog that stopped along the Delimbiyr to harvest mushrooms in the Blackbranch forest. Several were taken and the few that managed to escape fled without their companions.

The family hosted the defenders for the night, and planned to change residences to avoid the wrath of any returning houseguards. 

During the night, some of the party began experiencing vivid and unsettling dreams, filled with spiderwebs, eerie whispers, and a sense of impending doom. 

Continuing into the forest, some had vivid and unsettling dreams of spiderwebs, eerie whispers, and a sense of impending doom.

The forest became darker and the atmosphere took on an eerie and foreboding quality. The trees became gnarled and twisted, their branches interlaced with thick cobwebs that stretch from trunk to trunk like a sinister tapestry, reinforcing the fairy’s cautions and the recent nightmares. 

After moving toward a webbed clearing, the company managed to get the drop on the arachnids, achieving surprise by Mara drawing them out with a mage hand plucking a nearby web, with knowledge from Theren’s familiar terrain. 

What could have been a dangerous encounter was defeated without 
injury. 

What lies ahead? <cue dramatic music>

The farmers relayed the traders name is Cara and she is a Sword Coast trader tha usually works the Delimbiyr River trade route. She is an accomplished navigator and knowledgeable merchant. 

Cara is a young woman with short, dark hair and piercing brown eyes. She is of average height and build, with a wiry strength that comes from years of traveling the Sword Coast. She is often dressed in simple, practical clothing, but she always wears a silver necklace with a pendant of a wolf's head.

    She has a tattoo of a wolf's paw on her left forearm.
    She has a scar on her right cheek from a bear attack.
    She has a silver earring in her right ear.

Her crew has been asking around and offering a reward for her safe return.

# Session 2 - _Poisoned Skies - Darkening of the Wood_
2023-07-26

The players continued following the lead given to Mara by the fairy in the market and headed into the Blackbranch forest. 

The fairy (who mysteriously neglected to give her name) seeks the aid of the players, sharing her concerns about the deteriorating state of the forest. She suspects dark magic at work and asks the players to investigate the cause and restore balance to the forest.

The once lush and peaceful forest Blackbranch has been slowly turning into a dark and foreboding place. 

Further, the family the players assisted in Stillwater mentioned several traders from an oared cog with goods destined for Waterdeep have gone missing while venturing into Blackbranch to forage mushrooms after mooring their cog, leaving behind only shredded clothes and signs of a struggle.

After defeating the initial group of spiders, apparently on the prowl, the party ventured further. 

As you emerged into a clearing, an eerie sight unfolded before you. The ground is carpeted with a thick layer of webs, spun intricately between the surrounding trees and across the clearing like a gossamer veil.

In the center of the clearing, a once-majestic tree stands, now decayed and hollowed out, its bark worn and weathered. The tree's skeletal branches reach out like twisted arms, adorned with a macabre display. From its gnarled branches, desiccated humanoids are suspended, their bodies wrapped tightly in silken cocoons of spider webs. The victims' features are obscured by the webbing, their forms suspended in a grotesque dance of death. Some are left to dangle freely, while others have been carefully placed within the hollowed trunk, their lifeless forms arranged with unsettling precision.

The party fought another group of spiders, one of which could phase in and out of seeming existence. 

After defeating those spiders, you followed the spiders' trail until you emerged from dense foliage, and spotted three cave entrances scattered along the hillside. The right entrance is a sinkhole going down in a series of 5-6 foot dirt embankments to a rough hole leading down. It appears as a dark maw within the rocky outcrop with jagged edges and a narrow opening.

You opted for the narrow cleft between two rocks, about 15' up the hillside. 

The party lit a spider web on fire, that attracted two spider swarms, a handful of smaller spiders and an unsettling spider shepherd with features both human and arachnid. 

What lies ahead?

# Session 3 - _Poisoned Skies - Darkening of the Wood_
2023-08-09

After delving further into the spiders' underground lair, on the upper west side of the cavern is a collection of cocooned bodies, bones and refuse, demonstrating these spiders answer nature’s call where they feed. Upon inspection, one of the bodies wears a pendant adorned with a stylized dragon symbol. Amongst the refuse are the remains of several used poison kits. 

The party then explored the main multi-tiered cavern, with a high ledge on the left side that is over 40 feet above the floor level of the cave, and the each tier on the north side of the cave being roughly 7-9 feet above the tier before it.

On the very highest of the east ledges, among the recently gnawed remnants of a human corpse is a web-cocooned humanoid. If freed, Cara is poisoned, but alive. With nurture she regained consciousness after one hour, and wanted to look for her fellow traders, however, all of which are dead. 

Amongst the treasure the spiders have accumulated are the remains of several used poison kits. 

After parlaying with the clutter queen, trading her life for the coccon, the party also picked up a decorative scroll case. with what appears to be a locking mechanism adorned with dragons. On closer inspection, it appears to have a rotating dial, several glyphs, a relief of three dragons, elven runes and radiates abjuration and necromancy magic. The relief shows three encircled fighting dragons, a gold dragon attacking an indeterminate color dragon, which, in turn is attacking a red dragon, which in turn is attacking the gold dragon.  After opening the scroll case, two scrolls, Revivify and Mass Healing Word were discovered. 

The party headed back toward Daggerford, and everyone gained a level (2). On the way back, they tussled with another group of nobles who were in the process of summary execution, again, of a young adult if not a child.

# Session 4 - _Poisoned Skies - Temple of the Snake God_
2023-08-18

The party returned returned Hallis, the young adult rescued from the Liam's Hold Retinue, to his home in the outlying farms of Daggerford and headed into the city proper, with an eye out for the wanted posters. 

Some of the party went to the Black Stone Inn for some refreshements where they discovered a broken man, Alistair, who's faithful hunting dog Jax had been killed by misshapen, large bandits and was drowning his sorrows in drink. The party escorted Alistair safely to the barracks, where he spent the night.

After which, everyone ate and had a restful night, some at the Black Stone Inn, and others with Theren at his father's house.

The next morning, the party returned to the barracks to speak with Alistair and also met Serwyn, a Daggerford guard who mentioned Haldur, a seasoned and weathered trader who was also a collector, and has been searching for a Serpent Talisman, rumored to be near Blackhelm Tower. 

The party investigated and discovered a weathered lump of rock, seeming a natural formation at first. On closer inspection, you notice the faint remnants of a once-impressive statue. Carved from stone long ago, the statue now appears worn and aged, blending seamlessly with the surrounding rocks and vegetation.

The stone figure stands tall, its form distorted and weathered by the passage of time. Its shape suggests a powerful creature, with elongated limbs and a coiled body. The surface is covered in patches of moss and lichen, further camouflaging its true nature. Though its original details have faded, you can still discern hints of intricate carvings that once adorned its surface, hinting at the artistry that went into its creation.

After which, Theren noticed some footsteps and climbed the ridge to see a peculiar sight, a sturdy, elevated platform supported by a hulking creature. The platform is constructed from rough-hewn planks and lashed together with thick ropes and animal hide bindings. It provides ample space for four small individuals to stand or sit, each equipped with weapons and gear. The makeshift structure is fortified with barricades of stacked shields and salvaged materials, forming a protective barrier around the riders. Atop the platform, you see a collection of crates, barrels, and sacks secured tightly to prevent them from shifting during movement. The entire contraption sways with the creature's heavy footsteps, revealing its improvised nature. The riders, clad in mismatched armor and wielding a variety of weapons, maintain a vigilant watch, their eyes scanning the surroundings for any signs of danger.

Near the ogre's death, after killing or routing the goblins and bloodying the ogre, the ogre blew a horn. 

Out of the ruins of a nearby tower came two more large creatures, one wielding a massive ballista. After a somewhat grueling battle, the party sheltered in the ruined tower for a much needed rest.

# Session 5 - _Poisoned Skies - Temple of the Snake God_
2023-09-21

The party entered the structure under the tower after resting at the ground level. It was clear the ruins were only recently occupied by the ogre-kin, and the previous inhabitants had perished long ago, due to a cataclysmic event, leveling the structure above ground and sealing it's inhabitants to suffer slow and agonizing deaths. 

The party investigated the structure, defeated several ogres, rescued hostages and discovered a chamber with ritual wards for a serpent talisman. The item was retrieved successfully by following the rituals depicted in the murals.

The party also befriended a giant boar, serving the ogres. 

# Session 6 - _Poisoned Skies - Interim_
2023-10-12

The party returned the hostages, Rhys, an influential trader, from house Merriweather, Eira Rivenwood, an herbalist and mother figure to the other hostages, Gwenneth, a teenage girl with surprising resilience,  who the ogre leader attempted to use as human shield, Aldric, a hunter from Daggerford and Eldra, a botanist determined to escape.

 After returning the rescued folk to their various places around the Delimbyr vale, the party encountered a distressed rancher, Fineas, suspicious of wolves after losing livestock, and a sage named Emyr, overly excited about the prospect of a long lost fort, and discovering it's secrets. 

The party set up watch at Fineas' ranch, and discovered some poisoned plants. Theren used his Primeval Awareness and detected aberrations, dragons, fey, fiends and undead within range. 

After un uneventful evening, the party elected to follow Emyr's direction and headed to the region between the Blackbranch and Blightwood forests.

# Session 7 - _Poisoned Skies - Grimhold_
2023-10-20

After un uneventful evening setting up watch at Fineas' farm, the party elected to follow Emyr's direction and headed to the region between the Blackbranch and Blightwood forests.

Along the way, the party encountered Barricade, a halfling Circle of the Moon Druid, examining a pig. After being a bit perturbed by the party's presence running off the pig, introductions were had. After discussing the party's recent events and determining common purpose, Barricade decided to join them on their journey to the ruined fort. 

On the way, Therin detected all manner of tracks, but in particular, wolf, a large monstrous wolf and something else, even more strange than the large monstrous wolves, but of similar size and nature. The wolf tracks seemed mundane, and not coming or going from any particular direction. However, the other large wolf-like tracks seemed to be coming and going in the direction of the ruined fort. 

Upon approach, the party came upon the crumbling remains of a once-mighty fortress looming before them, silhouetted against the sky. The weathered stone walls rise jaggedly, their surfaces marred by the ravages of time and neglect. The roofs have collapsed and much of the structure is exposed to the elements.

The party continued toward the fort, approaching in daylight, but using the stepped nature of the hill to approach from cover. After getting about half way up the hill, a large worg and goblin rider came out of the main entrance, 

At least one of the large wolf like creatures, now demystified did not notice the party at first, but the keen-eyed goblin spotted the starry formed tortle and directed his mount toward Eg. The party had delayed prepared attacks, hoping to stay undetected, but unleashed hell on the lone rider and his mount.

The party then approached the  southeast tower of the fort with an upper entrance, now nothing more than a hole in the wall, with signs it once had a staircase. After carefully peering in, they discovered more goblins, and a larger, somewhat fiendish looking goblin were eating and playing dice, not particularly alert as sentries. 

Barricade turned into a spider and began to scout the area. He managed to scout the lower level of the tower, where three hobgoblins were sleeping and eating and managed to skulk into the central ward of the keep, where he found the floor collapsed to a natural cave beneath the keep with a pool of water, presumably formed from exposure to the elements. 

After returning and conveying this information to the rest of the party, they came back around to the entrance on the main level. While attempting to decide on a course of action, another goblin rider and a lone goblin exited the fort. Another battle ensued and with precision, marksmanship and a bear, they were quickly dispatched. 

The party continued into the keep, first scouting out the upper level of the southwest tower and continuing in to the inner ward. Three hobgoblins emerged from the main level of the southeast tower. Steward, still disguised as a hobgoblin, attempted to lure them to the caves beneath the fort. He succeeded, but was discovered and a battle ensued. The hobgoblins and their captain were defeated, but not without expending some precious resources...

The first goblin that was killed had a satchel with some disgusting food and a letter of correspondence between the goblins. They mentioned allowing plundered stores to rot, making them far more delectable, filled with maggots... The letter also mentioned receiving spider poison, but did not elucidate on who from. The goblins also seem to be missing some patrols, but it was unclear as to why. After one such missing patrol had left, Grimgore, perhaps their leader, was seen leaving the fort.

# Session 8 - _Poisoned Skies - Grimhold_
2023-11-14

The party continued to explore the ruined keep, entering the inner ward where they got the jump on the hobgoblins in main floor of the southeast tower. 

## Note
It was questioned why the party did not get surprise. I mentioned you weren't all hiding but wanted to explain a bit further here. Usually, this means you are hiding. While the inner ward was brightly lit (which obviates hiding without cover), there was plenty of cover (total cover guarantees success, half cover grants a Stealth check). However, in order to have line of sight for an attack, Therin and was directly in line with the door.  In order to achieve surprise, an enemy must not notice any threat - meaning, even noticing one party member spoils surprise. If you all make Stealth checks, only the lowest roll matters, with respect to surprise. However, many of you did achieve attacking as an unseen attacker for your first attack. Surprise and being an unseen attacker are related, but you can have both or one without the other, depending on circumstances. You can also have one or more enemies that are surprised while others are not. 

To be fair, upon reflection, I should have probably still had at least the first hobgoblin be surprised, because the enemy did not expect anyone to be in the inner ward and at the point they opened the door, everyone was behind total cover. 


After a tough battle with the hobgoblins, the party proceeded into the northwest tower, where they fought a mixed group of goblins, hobgoblins and a bugbear. 

The party then proceeded into the caves below the complex where they fought hobgoblins, a bugbear and Grimgore, a fearsome goblin that transformed into a horrifying and twisted hybrid of wolf and goblin. 

The barghest Grimgore moved around the tunnels to avoid being seen by the goblinoids while using its powerful form.

After defeating the rest of the goblinoids and Grimgore, the session ended. 

Are there lingering golbinoids in the keep? What was in the journal? What about the northeast tower?

Just a reminder - if you see a journal, runes, a scroll or any form of writing, the DM is likely trying to communicate information to you :slight_smile:

Another reminder - don't forget the short rests! Unless one combat bleeds into another, or there are sentries on patrol, you generally can take a short rest once you've secured your current location.

# Session 9 - _Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker - _The Mountain Door__
2023-11-17

The party finished searching Grimhold, the dwarven keep previously inhabited by goblinoids lead by a barghest and headed back to Daggerford, where they were greeted as heroes by Captain Arayndar Delimbiyr. In response to your many accomplishments, and the ongoing troubles with the nobles, the captain requested you attend a council of nobles, being held at Anteos Manner.

After a day spent resupplying and some  etiquette training from Steward, Theren headed to his family's residence and the rest retired in a room at the River Shining. Early in the morning, loud noises awoke everyone and it turned out to be the barkeep punching out a petty thug with overblown ideas of being a hit man. He had a flyer from one of the noble houses with a reward that had gone up significantly since the last one you all saw.

The party then regrouped with Theren and headed to Anteos Manor after hiring a horse, carriage and rider. Arriving in style, the party was met by both sneers and many thanks from the various attendants. After a feast, just before Lady Bronwyn Daggerford was about to make some announcements, terrible screams were heard outside, followed by shouts of "Dragon!".

While most were diving under tables or fleeing to rooms without windows, the party viewed the destruction through the grand windows, where many lie dead and much of the structure was eaten away from the corrosive breath of the dragon. Captain Arayndar Delimbiyr (possibly pronounced "uh reindeer"), shouted, "to the roof!" and the party followed, along with a few brave soldiers of Daggerford.

But, as you arrived on the roof, you only got a glimpse of the dragon as it flew away east. It was without doubt, a black dragon, likely of the "Young" variety.

Captain Arayndar discussed with the party a local cutpurse, Nelix, pitied by Sergeant Delphine after arresting her. Nelix told the Sergeant she had been following a group of suspicious zealots, thinking them a possible mark. She overheard them mention Theraldur, an ancient Dwarf-hold in the Lizard Marshes thought lost to the ravages of time. The Captain didn't think much of it, but did some research anyway, and discovered a map to the ancient fortress. He thrust in into the party's hands with hearty "Good luck!"

Before heading down the stairs, Lady Bronwyn approached Theren,  bravely holding back tears, grabbed his arm and offered him three black feathered arrows. Unable to speak, she simply nodded. It was later determined one was magical, an Arrow of Slaying Black Dragons.

The party headed into the Marsh. Whether due to the eeriness of the swamp or the recent shadow of the dragon, your journey was unchallenged.

A path meandered up a switchback, rising out of the swamp toward a bare shoulder of rock. Two lizardfolk were found to be unattentively guarding the entrance. After killing one, the other fled into the complex. Barricade took up chase, only to be targeted from cleverly disguised murder holes. Eg followed close behind while Theren and Steward hung back.

Barricade was able to see a chamber with a narrow ledge overlooking a deep, dark crevasse that cuts the room in two. A dangerous-looking rope bridge, frayed and thin, spans the gap. Water gurgles and rushes somewhere far below.

Explored so far...

# Session 10 - _Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker - _The Mountain Door__
2023-12-07

(*Steward*)
We pushed our way deeper inside the cave, taking out several lizardmen along the way to a rope bridge.

After we cross the bridge, we enter a space filled with old dwarven furniture and a cage. In the caged area are two captives: Garrett,  human from farming settlement, Union. Neelix, Elf lady with daggers. After we freed them, the man left after we gave him a weapon. Nelix stayed with us.
We were told Ixira is the name of the acid dragon.

Nelix told us the cave was made by the Dwarf clan Forgespire. They built Theroldor(?) to defend against enemy menaces and work with the Bronze Dragon Zephira. They left the outpost open to attack and bronze dragon was killed.

Party went ahead and encountered Lizard Queen and her attendants. Crazy battle ensued. Nelix helped take out the baddies.

Afterwards, Nelix told us how she was a cutpurse who ended up finding and raising the last egg of the bronze dragon and is here to kill the acid dragon.

# Session 11 - _Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker _Glitterhame__
2023-12-26

After defeating the lizardfolk queen, the party descended to the Glitterhame, the former mines for the Forgespire dwarves, a large series of natural caverns in the heart of the Theraldur.

After examining carefully several dwarven sarcophagi and leaving them unlooted, the party encountered a roper and it's piercer children guarding the Dwarf Door. 

The party found a key that opened the door on a mold covered skeleton and secured the area for a much needed rest.

Beyond the door was a long stair leading to a room with dwarven statues, but it was only briefly examined for enemies and left for after the rest.

# Session 12 - _Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker _The Foundry__
2024-01-16

## Chamber of Statues
After a much needed rest, the party entered the octagonal chamber, with three large statues and and two northern doors between them. After some brief investigation, it was discovered there was a secret door to the east and likely that opening either of the northern doors would trigger the statues to attack. Further investigation revealed they were in fact false doors. The party traveled through the secret door, up a staircase, where a pressure plate triggered a magic mouth in the relief of a dwarf's head in the eastern door at the top of the stairs to shout out a warning. 

## The Great hall
The party proceeded to enter a large, well lit hall with columns spanning west to east, with a dais on the eastern end and a small campsite in front of it. Quickly it was determined that several lizadfolk cultists were waiting behind the columns to ambush the party. Several were initiates but two were dragonclaw spellcasters.

## The Foundry
After defeating the lizardfolk in the great hall, the party entered the foundry to the south, where several initiates were attempting to forge a blade. Steward, posing as a lizardfolk drew them into the Great Hall, where they were quickly dispatched. A cavern to the east was discovered that lead to a great chasm with a chain ladder. It was decided that they should continue clearing this level before descending. 

## Courtyard and Commons
An ancient battle space was discovered, where many dwarves and a great many more lizardfolk lost their lives. The dwarven courtyard and commons area was littered with corpses. 

## Desecrated Shrine
To the west, a shrine was discovered. Eg used detect magic and determined the presence of abjuration at the altar and at least three sources of necromancy nearby. The party decided to save this for later.

## Horin's Quarters and Council Chamber
After encircling the eastern portion of the foundry, the party discovered a secret exit from Horin's quarters, the famed leader and great smith of the dwarven enclave. The area was now housing the cult's leader, Nimira, a powerful lizardfolk dragonfang. She was surprised sleeping, out of her armor, so the party chose to take the initiative. During the fight, her first lieutenant, Varak, a dragonwing wielding a greataxe entered the fight from the Council Chamber to the east. Steward tricked Varak into running back into the Council Chamber with a minor illusion, but Varak's loyalty to Nimira brought him back. After the party defeated the two, they discovered a satchel with the Dawnbreaker manifesto. 

*The Dawnbreakers are a faction of the Keepers of the Sacred Horn, known as the Horns of the Black Beast, or simply, Dawnbreakers. As with other Cult of the Dragon followers, they venerate dragons, especially undead dragons. The Dawnbreakers are devoted to Ixira, raising her in life to at least 100 years (she is in her late 90s), then with the intention of performing the rituals to elevate her to dracolich status. A special black sapphire talisman has been designated as her phylactery. They are fully committed devotees, working with any allies they deem useful, mentioning specifically the goblins of Grimhold, the giants of Vith Rah (Temple of the Snake God), the spider clutter of Blackbranch as well as are several noble houses of Daggerford, though they appear to be in some form of code, as the names are draconic for “feathered house”, “black house” and several lumped in as “houses of gluttony”.*

*Namira and her captain*

# Session 13 - _Poisoned Skies - Dawnbreaker _The Black Lake__
2024-01-16

(*Lulu*)
Theren made an abrupt departure for home due to his father’s failing health, promising to be ready if any attacks befall Daggerford.  He hurriedly hands the 3 arrows and the potion of greater healing to Nelix and is gone.  Nelix then reveals her true identity (LuLu) to the group, indicating she was hired by an unknown party from Daggerford to investigate the misfortunes befalling the area, to see if they are related to the supposed cultists and to determine if there is any involvement from any of the Daggerford nobles.  Yes to all.  The party doubles down on their commitment to finding and defeating the dragon, Ixira.

With the help of Garrett, the other freed captive (from session 10), the party returns to the desiccated shrine room and eliminates the last 3 undead Dawnbreakers.  They find a pouch of 600 gp, a bone scroll case with a scroll of web and a scroll of spider climb and are gifted a tablet by Horin’s freed spirit.  Confident they’ve cleared this floor of the ruins, they head to the chain ladder and descend into the caverns underneath Theraldur.

After scouting a bit and a few minutes of well-executed mending on the bridge, the party finds their quarry:  Ixira rests on an island in a small (but deep) lake.  They prepare for battle as the dragon slips below the surface, only to emerge much closer and ready for a fight.  They trade blows, Ixira dealing far more damage than she took, at one point knocking Barricade out.  But with a few lucky shots, some spells, a lot of healing, the use of Horin’s tablet, and the arrival of the bronze dragon wyrmling, Telarion, the last of Theren’s 3 magic arrows provided the final blow to the big black dragon. (whew!)

Treasure was collected and the party got the heck outta Dodge.

*The cylinder contains a parchment with secret orders, written in Aragrakh, an ancient dialect of draconic. 
The orders, dated several days ago, direct followers from house Ambergul, Halyndliam and Cromm, to head north to Leilon. Daggerford has become aware of their efforts and Ixira has been slain. Leilon is rebuilding and still weak enough not to oppose them and there are many allies in the region, including the Dreadscale Disciples (evidently another sect of the Keepers of the Sacred Horn), who have been working in Leilon for months. 
Alicia, consort of Kord Reynard Ambergul was kidnapped and taken to house Shahid. 
The last line reads, Focus efforts on preparing Alicia and assisting the Dreadscale Disciples.*

*Yellowcrest Manor stands on Delzorin Street, between Vhezoar Street and Brondar’s Way in Waterdeep's North Ward.*
*Lord Viallis and Lady Maria had two sons, Malik and Janus, and one daughter, Tianna.*
*The family owned several tanneries and shoemaking shops in Waterdeep, but most of its wealth was inherited on Maria's side.*
*Lord Viallis' closest business associate was a half-drow named Faerl, who visited Lord Viallis twice a tenday.*

(*Mara*)
The party journeyed north offering their 'escort services' to [some NPC] headed to Waterdeep. This gave them an opportunity to turn a trip they were going to make anyway into one that also paid. The journey took 7 days, and Leilon (their ultimate destination) lay another 10 days out, but an interesting opportunity presented itself to address first in Waterdeep.

(*Lulu*)
_From LuLu’s Journal_
Entry #72:
Wow what a few days it’s been.  So glad that dragon’s gone.  We got some nice loot too.  I REALLY wanted to collect some of that acid, but we couldn’t make it work.  I like my new bow, though – dwarven made!
We left Theraldur (I can imagine what a great place it was in it’s heyday!) and headed back to Daggerford to report our activities and findings (that “manifesto” was going to help) when we were ambushed (sorry Ada.)  There were some more cultists who attacked.  Thankfully, there were 2 more people sent from Daggerforld to help out in the cultist hunt who showed up and helped us defeat them.  Reichart and Padrick were actually pretty awesome. We kept one cultist alive for questioning, and I got a bit overzealous (as usual).  I think I scared Pad a little (maybe Eg too to be honest.)  I need to tone it down.  We learned about some future plans by the cultists – they even had some secret orders in ANCIENT Draconic, which of course, Steward knew.  It named the Daggerford Houses involved, and new plans changing focus to the north in Leilon.
We turned our captive in to authorities in Daggerford and presented our information to Lady Daggerford.  She was very intrigued by the mention of Leilon and filled us in on some details, and seemed very curious about the Keepers of the Sacred Horn.  Again, overzealous me became suspicious of her ability to speak (sort of) ancient draconic.  I mean, we ARE hunting dragon cultists.
Then we went shopping with our new friends.  And yes, you're right Mom, sometimes you do make friends quickly when adventuring.  I wonder if Barricade has figured out yet that Pad isn’t using Druid magic to change into a hare.
More later. 
Entry #73
We took a small job escorting a caravan of goods to Waterdeep (since we needed to go that direction anyway.)  Uneventful.  Except when we came across a large tree blocking the road.  Guess who got overzealous again, thinking it was another ambush?  We actually got rewarded by some Waterdeep guards with some really nice wine for moving the tree out of the way.
Oh yeah.  Before we made it all the way to Waterdeep, we actually ran into a spirit.  Crazy.  Barricade (that dude fears nothing) let it possess him.  We found out she was Sarah, a servant of a Waterdeep family who had witnessed some pretty scary things: ritual casting, rune circles, a tome bearing an image of a monster, and the murder of the whole family and their house (Yellowcrest Manor).  I think everyone wants to investigate when we get to WD and maybe see if we can help Sarah and the rest of the poor trapped souls.
Although we do have a cult to stop.  More later

*In her distressed rants, the poor servant's spirit to reveals this information:*
*- Yellowcrest Manor stands on Delzorin Street, between Vhezoar Street and Brondar’s Way in Waterdeep's North Ward.*
*- Lord Viallis and Lady Maria had two sons, Malik and Janus, and one daughter, Tianna.*
*- The family owned several tanneries and shoemaking shops in Waterdeep, but most of its wealth was inherited on Maria's side.*
*- Lord Viallis' closest business associate was an elf named Faerl, who visited Lord Viallis twice a tenday.*

2024-03-07

## Research
Eg and Pad studied the archives at the Great Library, Lulu and RIck put ears to the ground in the seedy underworld, Reichart toured the temples while Steward gain access to court records and cozied to various nobility, carefully hinting at various indiscretions to loosen lips. _I should have written this sooner - I don't recall exactly what everyone was doing._ In the course of their investigations, the party learned the following. 

- Lord Yellowcrest was away from Waterdeep on business, then returned to find his wife, his sons and daughter, and the manor's four servants brutally murdered. Shocked into a deep depression by the tragedy, Lord Yellowcrest left Waterdeep to be alone with his grief.
- Rumors seemingly spread by members of the City Guard after investigating the murders hinted at some sort of cult activity, but details of the killings were never revealed. No suspects were ever identified or charged.
- The Yellowcrest family had a good reputation, with no hint of personal or public impropriety. No one ever accused the grieving Lord Yellowcrest of having any connection to the murders.
- Research in Waterdeep turns up references in other works to a book whose cover matches Sarah's sketch—a tome called Retribution of the Ancients.
- Lord Viallis, wanting to get away from talk of his family's death, moved to the newly re-inhabited village of Leilon, a tenday's travel north of Waterdeep, along the Sword Coast.

## Interviewing the Butler
While visiting the manor itself, the party learned the following from Arnulf, the current residents' butler. 
- The manor was previously owned by the Yellowcrest family, most of whom were killed one night.
- Though full details of the event were never made public, rumor holds that Lady Maria, her three children, and four servants were all stabbed to death, then had their tongues removed.
- The sole survivor of the family was Lord Viallis, who was allegedly away from the city that day.
- After the murders, Viallis sold the manor and all his family's possessions, then moved to a small village in the countryside.
- A few tanneries, leatherworkers' shops, and cobblers' shops in the Trades Ward off the Way of the Dragon, reportedly still belong to Lord Viallis, but if he has ever returned to Waterdeep, Arnulf doesn't know about it.

## Visting the tanneries, cobblers and leatherworkers
Visiting the various shops the players learned the following. 
- Lord Viallis has an overseer who comes once every second tenday to check the books of each enterprise, pay wages, and collect profits. 
- The overseer, an elf named Faerl, lives in the village of Leilon approximately midway between Waterdeep and Neverwinter, and is expected in the tomorrow morning.

After which, the party stayed at the inn for the evening and returned early to stake out the tannery.

## Faerl's arrival
Faerl arrived in a black coach, accompanied by several bodyguards. In brief conversation, Faerl divulged the following. 
- The fact that no one was ever charged with the crime "a terrible injustice." 
- If asked about Lord Viallis, Faerl describes him as "broken by the tragedy." 
- He denies that his employer could have had anything to do with those terrible events if any character suggests it.
It was clear at this point, Faerl had had enough questioning, and ordered his guards to escort him to the coach. 
_We rolled initiative and paused the game. This is where we'll pick up next session._

# Session 16 - _Weald of Woe - _Leilon__

Siedan Muhar, boar stalker, a brawny Reshimi hunting a boar
Leilon history
- Once a mining town
- Town was formed a few centuries ago by a wizard, Thalivar, who was luring planar creatures into traps in his tower for research. After the spellplague wreaked havoc on his defenses, many of the creatures got loose and terrorized the town and it was quickly overrun. The remaining townsfolk abandoned the area and it remained that way for more than a century. 
- A contingent of soldiers from Neverwinter destroyed the planar beacon, working to make the town safe for those that wish to rebuild and settle here. Working with a town council to revive the towns fishing industry, along with two itinerant priests, Kithrin of Lathandar and Vangol, a judge of Tyr.
- Umaira Shahid bought the old Thalivar house, foul stench, open to the air, soldiers said it was haunted.
- Some shady folks were seen going in and out of the old Thalivar place, dressed as soldiers, but after the soldiers had turned the place over to Umaira. 
- Didn't know of Viallis.
- Alice and Ava were returned unharmed. They had been missing for a tenday. Nobody knows what happened, but Kithrin said their safe return was a sign of a bright future for the town. 
- Alice runs the haberdashery.

Alion the half-elf that runs the Umber Hulk's Shell Inn mentioned _One of the settlers was planning on purchasing a newly reconstructed home near the House of Thalivar, only, he said he swore he saw a ghost hanging from the scaffolding boom! He’s still on the market for a home in Leilon, but not there for sure!_

# Session 17 - _Weald of Woe - _Leilon__
2024-04-19

Eg, Lulu, Steward and Barricade roamed Leilon looking for information. 

Steward setup at the Umber Hulk's Shell Inn, assisting Alion with duties around the inn, and taking in the conversation. Steward learned while Valdi is a skilled tanner, he doesn't appear to have any connection to Vialis. He is in charge of the fishing industry in Leilon, both generating revenue and sustenance for the town. Sergeant Bersk Yorrum also called on the inn for lunch and Steward learned while in charge of the Neverwinter soldiers, he defers to Umaira for decisions regarding the town's rebuilding. However, at least as of late, Umaira has become even more eccentric than normal, is forgetful, exhausted and guarded about his research. Steward also learned of Nenelyn, a gruff female dwarf tasked with the construction work. None would dare to her face, but she's often referred to as the "the Growler" for her intense demeanor and work ethic. Best to follow her orders and stay on her good side... 

Ava and Alice were found at the Haberdashery by Lulu and Barricade and it was discovered Alice had been drugged, by Barricade bravely test tasting some residue in a cup and promptly falling asleep. Later that evening, they scaled the scaffolding on the Thalivar house and discovered above the third floor window head an inscription in Aragrakh, an ancient dialect of draconic, "ipvis qsowevi tepdvyn", meaning "enter private sanctum" and discovered Umaira in his nightgown rummaging through the rubble at the top floor, open to the elements. He did not seem himself and mistook Barricade in cat form for "Soapwort". They decided to flee down the stairs after Umaira scaled down the outer walls like a spider.

Eg studied news clippings and journals in the small Candlekeep annex in Leilon. He found information about the Swords of Leilon, adventurers who had protected the town in the past. They defeated a powerful evil wizard (?) who somehow bound their souls to this plane. This is likely the source of at least some of the ghost stories surrounding Leilon. Eg also learned a bit more about the beacon - it was used by Thalivar to draw extra planar creatures to his tower, where he trapped and studied them. However, during the spell plague, his traps were disabled, but the beacon remained open, with all manner of creatures destroying and driving out the residents of Leilon. The Neverwinter soldiers destroyed the beacon, resulting in the current state of Thalivar's tower. Later Eg snoozed on the docks and was met by a dream of him being a savior to the town and received inspiration.

The next morning, the group decided to visit Umaira at the tower and discovered he had no memory whatsoever of the previous night's events and was indeed exhausted. Eg's detect magic was a bit overwhelming in the tower, but it was unclear if there were magical items or if it was simply from the vast library of the former owner.

*Lulu’s Journal
Entry #76
We entered Leilon (after wringing all we could from Faerl and sending him on his way – if he knew
anything, he wasn’t sharing. But he DID react when I asked him about the Retribution of the
Ancients. We should try to find that book.) We’re checking in to the Umber Hulk’s Shell Inn. We’ll
probably ask the innkeeper for some information, to go along with what we learned from Seiden on
the road, and the guards at the Leilon gates. So many threads to be investigated, we may split up
again.
More later.*

*Lulu’s Journal
Entry #77
Well, eventful day. Have to admit I’m a little on edge from all that’s happened, so I’m writing as a
way to calm down.
We did split up, with Steward staying at the inn listening in on the day’s gossip, under the guise of
helping Alion. He got some good information about what’s going on in town. Eg also did his typical
research and was able to fill in some gaps and clarify some things about the town hauntings.
Barricade and I talked to Alice, the one who went missing with her daughter. We now believe she
was drugged and kidnapped (thanks to Barricade trying some of the questionable substance we
found – he’s gonna get himself killed), although it wasn’t clear why. Then, anyway. Now, we may
have a viable explanation – Viallis (yep the one whose family died in Waterdeep) may have taken
them to REPLACE his own family, at least for a while (thanks to Steward for that disturbing theory.)
We also went to the temple where A&A were returned. Spoke with Kithrin of the Shrine of
Lathandar.*

*Barricade and I also decided to go on a nighttime “ghost walk” to see what Leilon was like at night.
So of course, he barrels straight for the Thalivar tower, which was home long ago to an evil wizard
who used a planar beacon to bring creatures from other planes here for his study – what could go
wrong? Everything, apparently, since it led to the destruction of Leilon. The tower now belongs to
Umaira Shahid (remember that name from Daggerford?) Turns out Shahid was in some kind of
trance, almost seeming to be possessed by Thalivar! We interacted with him a little too long and he
took a header oƯ the top of the tower, then climbed down the side like a spider. It was super freaky.
Was it dumb for the 2 of us to go up the tower alone at night? Yep. Could we have been killed? Yep.
But we weren’t. And it feels like we learned so much. And it was kinda funny too. There I was
climbing up this scaƯolding on the outside of the tower, with Barricade as a cat hanging on my
shoulder, and we meet this guy in his nightgown acting really weird. If it wasn’t so disturbing, I’d
have been laughing.
So here’s my theory: this is one of those places you told me about where the veil between the living
and dead is thin. It explains a lot. Alice has vague “dreamy” memories of both she and her
daughter being pampered, but it’s all foggy. Umaira Shahid complains during the day of being
exhausted and having to study his papers. When we confronted him, he very much seemed to be
speaking as if he was someone else. I think that the dead are able to enter the living while they are
sleeping. My guess is Viallis realized his family could only inhabit Alice and Ava while they were
asleep, and it wasn’t sustainable. So he let them go. We may try to speak with Viallis about this.
Likewise, Thalivar has been able to take over Umaira Shahid during his sleep, having Shahid
continue Thalivar’s research.*

*But what set oƯ all of this? I have a feeling it’s got something to do with those Dreadscale Disciples
and the woman they abducted, and maybe that book. Wonder if the book is at the tower. We’re
going back to talk to Umaira tomorrow, after checking out Idol Island.
Meditating a few minutes to clear my mind, so hopefully I don’t play host to some dead soul after I
fall asleep.
More later.
PS – can all this be simply coincidence? Umaira Shahid’s strange behavior, the
disappearance/return of Alice & Ava, Viallis, the ghost sightings in Leilon, the Retribution of the
Ancients, the Dreadscale Disciples????? Too many threads, gotta be related. Meditating isn’t going
well.*

# Session 18 - _Weald of Woe - _Mystic Reverie__
2024-05-11

Party perused Leilon, picking up on leads, trying to determine if Umaira was a threat, largely concluding he wasn't aware of his possession. While perusing the Peculiarities Shoppe (Ursten's NOT Aubrey's) a painting of the Swords of Leilon was discoverd and Usrten informed the party they were Aubrey Silverspun, Augusta Krul and Ogri Ninebeards.

After dusk, they split up with Eg and Steward taking the tower's spiral stairs and Lulu and Barricade scaling the scaffolding. Barricade transformed into a cat. Eg and Steward stopped to peruse the library a bit before continuing while Lulu and Barricade seemed to have triggered the ward on the window. After the party gathered on the scaffolding outside the third floor window, the words were read and they entered the blocked off chamber. It was quickly evident this was Thalivar's former bedroom. There were notes, most old, but some more recent, indicating perhaps Umaira, possessed by Thalivar was taking notes here often. Also in the room was a full length mirror, covered with a mourning cloth, which Eg unceremoniously removed to expose a clearly enchanted silver mirror. As one would approach the mirror, it would entice the viewer with flattery and grooming advice, beckoning them to reach into the mirror. While no one was glamoured by the magic, eventually someone touched the surface. A mist rose around and from the mirror and contact with the mirror caused the person to disappear. After some consternation, everyone took the plunge. 

Moments later, everyone arrived in a formerly serene, forested grove, now dark and twisted, with clear signs of recent trimming, maintaining the perimeter of the path. Along the path were several stone carved lilies, serving as sign posts. Closest to the path, the colors are more vibrant and air crisper. with subdued sounds coming from the forest and a loud din of insects. The forest feels both familiar and foreign, serene and dark.

The party followed the path (with some technical issues since John/DM hadn't updated the map in a while...) and appeared before a grand temple and bathhouse in a large grove, with walls and floors of polished stone and finely carved wooden doors, engraved with images of water lilies. The windows displayed abstract signs in stained glass, providing the temple with bright light in a myriad of colors. 

The party proceeded through the main entrance, where bells announced your arrival, but not before Eg had determined through magic that the attendant they were about to meet was an outsider; an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead, with strong indications of fiend (technical difficulty, please stand by). A dark-haired man in garish clothes, a large beret with goose feathers, a white, puffy-armed tunic and purple breeches with black stockings came around the main desk, wide eyed and wide-smiled and began lavishing the party with welcomes and compliments and an invitation to take rest at this luxurious bathhouse. 

While the greeter, who introduced himself as Saeth was beckoning the party, someone opened the door to the lounge, seeing servants and several guests as well a slender moon elf with smooth black hair, sparkling eyes and bluish gray skin, Morganna, who also detected as an outsider, but clearly was a beautiful moon elf, possibly with a stronger fey heritage than is normal for an elf. She seemed to be managing the servants and seeing to the guests. The three guests were seated, enjoying the amenities, a well groomed, Waterdhavian half-drow and an injured Baldurian, both carrying themselves as a guard or soldier, and a lithe, youthful halfling who quickly rested her head on her fist, propping her elbow on the table, eyes darting around the room.

(*LULU’S (mental) JOURNAL*)

*Mental notes to add to my journal when I get a chance:
Steward would probably love to spend a week or two alone in the tower library.
We figured out how to get inside the “inner sanctum” – clearly Thalivar’s room.
Shahid’s been writing in Thalivar’s journal AS THALIVAR – I knew there was some kind of possession going on.
Note – NEVER pull a shroud off a mirror.  Just leave it be.
I’m so stupid!  What did I think was going to happen when I left Barricade alone with the mirror after Eg disappeared?
We are not in Leilon anymore.  It feels…fey maybe?  Something is tickling my memory about this situation.
Appears to be a luxurious spa/bathhouse, lilies everywhere.  Would seem dreamlike if not for the warning bells clanging thunderously in my head.
Names to remember: Saeth-greeter, dressed like a peacock, fey, maybe even fiend in disguise; Morgana-host/proprietor, moon elf but MORE, likely fey; also a few servants and several other guests.
No reaction to Viallis name-drop, but definitely knew of Alice and Ava (without admitting it).
Oh boy, we are being pushed hard to enter the baths.  Probably shouldn’t go in.*

# Session 19 - _Weald of Woe - Mystic Reverie_
2024-05-31

(*Eg's notes*)
*The party went into the hot spring and tested the waters, finding that it heals minor injuries. While discussing how to proceed with investigating the situation they found themselves in, they met Cyrena a Nyad who lives in the Hot Spring bath. She asks the group to locate the old proprietor "Sylvari Silverstone" who she believes is still alive and is being kept away by the current owners (Greensong, Morganna & Azira). Promising to find Sylvari, they depart from the bath to begin their investigations. Steward heads to the bar/staff quarters to assist the resort and gather information.
“ from conversation with the well dressed soldier - Stoth Dusksnow, a veteran of the Flaming Fist, a ruthless mercenary company based in the city of Baldur's Gate, has come to the temple to recover from a leg injury. The treatments and physical therapy are helping, but the mercenary is bored and looking for excitement.”
“Prader Nalambar, a half-drow, former Waterdhavian guard with thick, jet hair which is worn short of average height and his body is slightly underweight with moon-colored skin. He didn’t bring enough money for the services but has been trying to get discounts with smooth words.”
“Seraphina Leagallow, a halfling scout from the coastal city of Neverwinter”
Barricade heads to a workout area where he challenges a tree to tug of war & jump rope winning a potion of some form for his efforts.
Lulu heads to the hairstylist and requests a cut, upon digging into their story of why they’re there, they requested her to ask the following day and they’ll tell her more.
Eg ventures around the grounds and stumbles upon a Tsune shrine sealed with a black substance. He ignites it and douses it repeatedly along the doorframe until it’s loose enough to push open. Wandering inside he cleans up a statue that appeared to be crying and ventures into the basement where he meets Sylvari (who’s been turned into a Medusa). They speak for a while about the past, portals to this realm and what happened to her/how the new fiends took over the resort. Getting a brief explanation Eg heads off to meet his party to explain what he’s found and to speak with Cyrena again about finding Sylvari.*

The party, prompted by Saeth, visited the baths. They found the water to be imbued with healing magic. 

They also detected a presence in the water, a naiad, Cyrena, a fey creature bound to the spring much in the way a dryad is bound to a tree. Though it was evident she could be a formidable foe, the party quickly warmed to her and she told a story of a kind proprietor, Silvarie Silversong. It was clear she didn't quite understand the passage of time here, or with respect to the party, but was unhappy with the torment she faced with the current landlords, three fey sisters, Morganna, Azira and Greensong. She was unsure of the fate of Sylvarie, but hopeful she may still live. The party graciously agreed to investigate.

(*Lulu's Journal*)
*Quick notes, (pretending to write poetry while sitting under a tree “enjoying nature” so I don’t look suspicious while waiting for Barricade who’s in the tower.)
Bathhouse waters = healing, home to Cyrena (naiad)
Sylvarie Silversong – former proprietor (Cyrena wants her to come back)
Greensong/Azira/Morganna – disguised? – got rid of Sylvarie?
Tension b/w Azira & Morganna? Possible pt of weakness in trio?
Per Eg:
    Sylvarie Silversong is prisoner beneath shrine in back
    “Fetid Gaze” made the portal mirror – G/A/M?
    G/A/M tricked SS and took over here
    Portraits = imprisonment & transformation (of character & body)
Steward getting intel on guests – possible allies?
Empolyees:
    Dusk (trapped???) – possible ally
    Silent workers (in league w/ 3???) – probably our enemies, maybe more here
    Saeth (seems opportunistic, here by choice???) – if w/ ulterior motivation, could be swayed to help
How are portraits made? How to destroy (fire? water (Cyrena’s?) acid? magic?)
How do we get HOME?
Still waiting for Barricade.  Please: don’t get stepped on, do find portraits, do come back for help/to regroup.
More later.*

*Eg's conversation with Sylvarie*

*This grand temple and bathhouse rests in a serene and forested grove in a demiplane called Almare (elven for bliss), created by Lyranthia, an ancient eladrin, baelnorn witch-queen a thousand years ago. The demiplane shares traits of both Faerün and the feywild. It is rumored Lyranthia was building a “heaven” or sorts, but then it was lost to legend. 
Three hundred years ago, I, Sylvarie Silversong discovered a portal to Almare after visions bestowed by Sune led her to a small pond in the High Forest. Sune had created a grand temple over a hot spring infused with fey magic in the demiplane created by Lyranthia. 
I saw this as a divine calling to bring people here for respite, to rest and recover from the toils of life. 
For years, I traveled all around the Sword Coast, bringing all manner of folks to Almare, via the portal in the secret grove, deep in the High Forest.
However, it was not long until the Fetid Gaze, a hag coven living in an area of the Feywild coterminous with the area around the pond began to take notice. They tricked me into a bargain that allowed them to take over the temple. Before the hags defeated me, I tried to destroy the portal, in a last ditch effort to seal Almare off from the Sword Coast. The hags instead defeated me and, with their cruel magic, infused into the portal a charm, bound to a mirror on Faerün, such that when any looks into the mirror, it entices them to reach into the mirror to change their fate, teleporting them to Almare. 
These cruel and cunning fey now use the temple to lure the wealthy, greedy, and vain, preying on their insecurities and tricking them into accepting dark bargains that ultimately lead to misery.*

Lulu also spoke with "Dusk," a drow stylist who seemed eager to share his story, but not until the following day. 

Barricade, in spider form reconnoitered the tower to find the first floor guarded by one of the unspeaking servants, with  two doors unexplored, though viewed from the outside, one was clearly a bedroom with the other a lounge or studio, with a large chest. 

On reaching the second story of the tower, Barricade found the floor divided between a recently used kitchen and sparse quarters, like those used for prisoners or animals. In the quarters, however, were three humanoids in soldier's garb, not unlike the Neverwinter guards. Not wanting to disturb them, Barricade, the spider continued up the central spiral staircase. 

The third floor was trapped by a glyph and is a multi person bedroom, with three beds and a putrid scent, apparently coming from the beds, including one with a canopy made from flesh. The beds themselves are constructed from bones and animal hides. Stacked along the walls are hundreds of paintings.

Areas of the temple that have been explored: the grounds, lobby, lounge, garden, bath and hot spring, kitchen (a little), treatment rooms (Dusk), storage closet, shrine and tower. The only unexplored areas are the guest rooms. Some of the areas were only explored with a cursory glance.

# Session 20 - _Weald of Woe - Mystic Reverie_
2024-06-10

## All hell breaks loose
The party continued their investigations, ending the day taking up the offer to sleep in the guest quarters. During the night, Seraphina was discovered skulking about but otherwise, she seemed harmless enough, and interested in leaving. 

The next morning, Dusk was noticed coming out of his quarters and the party briefly spoke with him. 

Dusk mentioned he located and entered a portal in Waterdeep, just escaping a bout of blue flame as he entered. Fortunately, he did not bring the plague with him.

The astute Steward recognized the spellplauge hasn't been around for 100 years, hinting at time displacement in Almare. He seemed he had more tell, but the party was a bit guarded after recent events to share too much. Nonetheless, he put his shortsword and hand crossbow in his backpack.


After entering the lobby, Lulu noticed a disembodied eye disguised in the chandelier. She took a shot at it, only for Saeth to transform into a fiendish creature, with humanoid and fiendish features, red skin and black leathery wings. A fight ensued with Lulu and Steward while Barricade and Eg started heading over. Lulu kept singular focus on the eye and with advantage from Steward's Silvery Barbs, used to thwart a mighty spear blow from Saeth, Lulu's aim was true and destroyed the eye.

(*Lulu’s Journal*)

_Barricade made it back safely, minus a brush with acid (we should watch out for that later), and we made it back into the temple without drawing too much attention.  Retiring to the baths for some privacy allowed us all to share everything we’d learned so far.  Barricade found the jackpot, hundreds of paintings stacked along the walls in what appears to be a bedroom, albeit disgusting by his description.  We have to assume this is the home of the 3 proprietors, and the condition of the room just lends more weight to the assumption they are more than likely fiend or devil of some kind.  There are guards and silent servants in the tower.  Talking with Cyrena has changed my mind about approaching Saeth, trying to turn him against his employers.  Also, her healing waters can cure some conditions but are not able to remove curses.  We’ve reluctantly agreed to take to our assigned rooms for the night.  Steward has set up an alarm, but I’m taking my own precautions, and so it seems is Barricade.  Eg will be watching over Cyrena in the bathhouse._

_Not much sleep as the suspicious Serafina tried to sneak into my room, likely to steal what she could.  Learned some disturbing news – she was also brought here by looking into a mirror she found while “laying low” in some guy’s house in Neverwinter.  She claims to have been here a few weeks but seems a bit unsure._

_P.S.  It's morning and we’ve had a chance to approach some others – Dusk was also drawn here through a mirror, but details in his story have led Steward to believe he’s been here since the time of the Spellplague!  He also seems unaware of how long he’s been here (“a couple of months”.)  And Stoth, the merc, via mirror in a shop in Baldur’s Gate.  He seems to have come from the time just after the beacon had been destroyed in Leilon.  All 3 may be possible allies against the proprietors, Dusk is the most promising with sword and crossbow ready.  Stoth wants money.  And insists on being naked in the baths._

_Found out that the proprietors do indeed create the paintings and that all 3 are needed to make one.  Are they Demons?  Fiends?  Witches?  We were unable to prevent one of the guests from eagerly following them to have his portrait made.  This is probably our best chance, with the 3 preoccupied.  Fingers crossed._

_Still so many questions: What will happen to the portraits’ subjects if/when we destroy them?  Is the 3-part process the key to destroying them?  How will we get back to our own place?  HOW LONG HAVE WE REALLY BEEN HERE?_

# Session 21 - _Weald of Woe - Mystic Reverie_
2024-06-24

Players defeated Saeth in his cambion form. Found Sylvarie had turned most of the servants to stone and defeated the gargoyle. 
Entered the tower to find the hags had murdered Prader, the half-drow who accompanied them to get a painting, evidently in a rage after losing their sight! The keepers attempted to flee the complex with a bunch of the paintings, but were discovered and taken capture and locked in the changing rooms. All the paintings the party could get their hands on were destroyed using the healing waters of the bath. 

*What happened to Alice and Ava?*
*What are the keepers doing here?*
*What happens to the ones cursed by the paintings after the party destroy them if they are still alive?*
*What happens to the ones cursed by the paintings after the party destroy them if they are dead?*
*Is Sylvarie free?*

# Session 22 - _Weald of Woe - Phantom's Embrace_
2024-07-22

The adventurers, having destroyed the hags and defeated the dreadscale disciples learned of Ava's gruesome ordeal, but determined the death of Greensong (greenbones) meant Ava would live out the rest of her life ordinarily, perhaps Fey-Touched. They also met Sylvarie in her true form and learned a bit more of the history of Almare and were given a hand mirror, useable once per tenday, that will allow the party to travel to Almare and utilize the place for rest and recuperation. In the bath area, they also met a newcomer to Almare, Flankstake, a half-orc, Way of the Open Hand monk with a mysterious backstory...

*The product of an unsanctioned union, the child was abandoned and left for dead at birth. Discovered by monks and taken in to the monastery, the child was trained in the martial arts. The child's parentage always remains a lingering question and drives the character's wanderings.*

After travelling back to Leilon, through the portal, they discovered trouble near the gates. A mob of undead was headed toward the gate and were in hot pursuit of a beloved dog. After dealing with the mob, the players were approached by an Acolyte of Myrkul.

![image](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/d_ObInf4LR9bYnV1a1q1Of3xhfAmd_mv-jjnvbhygo8/%3Fsrc%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%253Fid%253D1NdKrOur0Z-DnmROVBx1W2Hnw9JGqgGhO%2523.png/https/imgsrv.roll20.net?format=webp&width=288&height=360)

*A cultist, Jebil wears a robe with the hallmark rope bones of Myrkul.

While procuring supplies, Jebil drops cryptic phrases or allude to rituals, mentioning terms associated with the Cult of Myrkul, though trying to conceal it in casual conversation. 

Jebil displays signs of unease or anxiety, constantly glancing around as if expecting trouble. This could suggest a fear of being discovered or a general discomfort with their current actions.*

## The Shattered Skull of a Demilich
*Ages ago, a powerful demilich, the darkheart, once a feared entity in the region, was vanquished by legendary heroes, the Swords of Leilon. The demilich and its phylactery were shattered upon its defeat, but the skull retained one soul gem with residual necromantic energies and fragments of the demilich's essence.*

*In Leilon, there are Myrkulyte clergy that work with the other faiths, serving those in need of hospice, funeral and burial. They don’t have a church propper in Leilon, but are largely tolerated as they are self-sufficient, taking fees as executors and serving the poor without compensation.*

*However, six months ago, a revenant doombringer of Hoar, Ulthane Andras, “Aptrgangr (again-walker),” infiltrated their ranks and rose to command them. He allows them to continue their services, but has been searching the surroundings for a suitable base of operations.*

*During this search, Ulthane stumbled upon an unmarked tomb, the final resting place of the darkheart, after being slain by the Swords of Leilon. However, in one last act of revenge, he bound their souls to this plane. The Swords cast seal on the tomb, but its magic has since waned. Ulthane broke the chains and entered the tomb. Within he found the shattered skull of a demilich.*

*Ulthane brought them to an abandoned, collapsed mine outside Leilon, where he ordered the clerics to excavate an entrance, hoping to find remains to harness the lingering necromantic energies of the skull. The mine was full of miners trapped by the collapse and they have determined that a ritual sacrifice empowers the demilich’s remnants to animate and control the dead.*

*The first few victims were kidnapped from Leilon, but after sacrificing a dragon initiate, they were discovered by the Dreadscale Disciples. Instead of conflict, the Dreadscale Disciples established a system of trade. They would bring souls to the gray ones in trade for the undead they create. To avoid bringing suspicion on the operation, they move the undead to the Mere of Dead Men hours before dawn, east around Leilon.*

*Jebil is a loyal Myrkulite, but feels that Ulthane is leading them away from their primary mission, easing the path to death. He knows the way to the manor near the mines. He doesn't know how to get into the mines, but knows Ulthane's followers come and go from the manor.*

(*LULU'S JOURNAL*)
_It feels like a month since I’ve written!
What a long day, and a weird one to be honest.  Highlights:
We’re alive and mostly unharmed (nothing a good night’s rest can’t help.)
We picked up a new friend (I hope). Flankstake was an accidental guest at the Restful Lily, and we found him taking in the waters.  I think we woke him up with our ruckus.
We defeated the 3 HAGS (I know Da, you told me to never cross paths with one, but it couldn’t be helped!)
Paintings destroyed, and souls (living and dead) set free.
Sylvarie restored and Almare is beginning to return to its former beauty.
Sylvarie gave us a mirror portal so we can visit anytime!
Forgot to mention, Saeth was a cambion (we defeated him) and destroyed the Hags’ Eye.
Made it back to Leilon without any lost time (whew!) only to thwart a hoard of undead aiming for the gate into the town._

_More devious cultist activity it seems – we stopped some thieves attempting to abscond with some of the paintings made by the hags.  They are Dreadscale Disciples (a sect of the Keepers of the Sacred Horn.) Remember them from a while back?  They were taking the paintings to trade as “soul coins” to the Myrkulites in Leilon.  Just, ugh.  We found out after getting back to Leilon that the Myrkulites have a new leader, a revenant Doombringer (not sure if I heard a name) who’s kind of changed their mission of overseeing the business of death and the dead into one of collecting souls.  The Doombringer has been using the remnant life-force from the skull of the demilich Darkheart to use the souls from the paintings (and from other dead) to form some sort of undead army.  For what purpose???
Another connection to the past – excess paintings were being traded by the Myrkulites to the followers of Lord Viallis.  Lord Viallis has followers?  In Leilon??  So we really need to follow up with this.  What is he the leader of, what about his book Retribution of the Ancients, and why are they collecting free souls (via the paintings)?  Are they behind the disappearances in Leilon?_

_And speaking of disappearances, we now know that the Dreadscale Disciples have been kidnapping babies in Leilon, including Ava, Alice’s daughter and taking them to the hags.  And the worst thing – Greensong/Greenbones ATE Ava and replaced her with her own daughter.  OMG.  The only good news about this seems to be that the child for all intents and purposes is still Ava.  She’s supposed to undergo a ritual with Greenbones at age 13 to transform into a hag so she can join the coven.  But alas, Greenbones is dead (and I think Sylvarie was going to burn the bodies.)  We all wrestled with how much, if any of this, to share with Alice.  I think we leave them in peace.  Maybe with Alice’s loving upbringing, Ava will live out a full life as a NOT hag._

_This is going to stay with me for a long time._
## Things to do:
- Find this place Viallis supposedly bought. He’s probably running his activities from there.
- Find the abandoned mines where the Doombringer is running his activities.
- Stop the supply line of revenant souls between the mines and the Mere of Dead mean, where it seems they are finding the bodies to use.  Somewhere in and between these 2 we should be able to find out why the Doombringer is doing this and stop him.
- Check out the items from Saeth and keep/sell/destroy as appropriate.
- Check on function/use of the potions and ingredients we found.
- Discuss with others maybe setting up a home for us here in Leilon.  Easier to set up defenses, maybe more comfortable, etc.

*PS Flankstake seems capable.  And he saved a dog, so he’s in.  I think he’s a monk.  He’s only wearing pants (that may have been due to the baths, we’ll see if more clothes show up later.)  And he’s super muscley.  Maybe he can help me with some strength training.  And he’s looking for his parents.  Maybe we can help.*

2024-09-06

After defeating the zombie horde, saving a dog and preventing the horde from entering Leilon, the party was approached by Jebil, who shared his concerns about the Myrkulite clergy being led down a different path by a doombringer of Hoar, Ulthane Andras, who discovered the remnants of a demi lich, defeated by the Swords of Leilon many years ago. Ulthane had taken up residence in the abandoned Hornraven estate, the family that ran the mines before the Spell Plague. 

The party explored the main floor of the home, wary after awakening spirits trapped in the house. The spirits seemed to be stuck in the past, but also aware of the present, aware that Ulthane was using their estate for dark purpose.

2024-09-09

The party then delved into the upper floors, triggering a lightning golem attack, exploring the upper floor and attic, until discovering a child's room and a vault. In Anara's room, they discovered her ghost, who evidently hid the cellar key under her pillow. 

Off to the cellar, key in hand, the party discovered an entrance to the mines, under a funerary preparation room. They entered the mines, finding a rift the former miners dug ore from, where they fought several of Ulthane's elite guardians, masters of trickery able to force enemies to do their bidding. It was looking dire, especially for Steward, who had fell into the rift. On seeing his guardians defeated, Ulthane attempted to shrowd himself in darkness and dimension door away from the party. Steward's misfortune became the party's boon, as he was able to stop Ulthane, after his concentration was broken, before managing to escape. 

What else lies in the mines? How are these Mykulite clergy tied to the Dreadscale Disciples? And what of Viallis' ties to this?

(*Barricade's claw writing*)

Last time, on the Dungeons & Dragons epic journey…

In the shadowy streets of Leilon, our heroes faced a harrowing encounter with the undead. A zombie horde surged toward the town gates, a beloved dog in peril. In a flash of steel and arcane might, they drove back the fiends, earning the gratitude of Leilon’s wary populace. But there was little time for rest…

Jebil, the anxious acolyte of Myrkul, approached with grave tidings. He spoke of a dark shift within the Myrkulite clergy, led astray by the malevolent Doombringer, Ulthane Andras. Ulthane, a revenant driven by vengeance, had unearthed the shattered remnants of a demilich’s skull, seeking to harness its vile power. His stronghold? The abandoned Hornraven estate, a place shrouded in ghostly whispers and long-forgotten secrets…

With courage in their hearts and steel in their hands, our adventurers ventured into the haunted halls of Hornraven. Spirits stirred as they crossed the threshold, warning of the dark machinations taking root within their ancestral home. Undeterred, the party pushed onward, delving into the upper floors where a lightning golem awaited. Sparks flew and the air crackled with energy as they fought tooth and nail, their resolve unyielding…

At last, they discovered the key to the cellar, held by the restless spirit of a child, Anara. With the key in hand, they descended into the depths, unearthing the path to the mines below. Here, they faced Ulthane’s elite guardians, tricksters capable of bending the will of even the bravest warrior. The battle was fierce, the outcome uncertain, as Steward fell into a dark rift… but it was this fall that proved to be Ulthane’s undoing.

As Ulthane attempted to vanish into the shadows, casting a spell to escape the party’s wrath, Steward—rising from the abyss—broke his concentration, sealing the Doombringer’s fate. But questions still linger like shadows on a moonless night…
What other horrors lie within the mines? How deep does the Myrkulite clergy’s corruption run? And what sinister ties bind them to Lord Viallis and the Dreadscale Disciples? The answers await, as the story unfolds…

Next time, on this thrilling Dungeons & Dragons adventure…

# Session 25 - _Weald of Woe - Phantom's Embrace - Epilogue_
2024-10-04

## Ulthane's Defeat
The party, emboldened by their recent victory, ventured deeper into the grim stronghold of the gray ones. Having just vanquished their feared leader, they felt a mix of exhilaration and trepidation as they began to ransack the vile place. Among the debris, they uncovered the shattered skull of the demilich, a haunting relic of power whose name had long been lost to history, now ominously referred to as Darkheart. The remnants whispered of ancient sorceries and a dark legacy that had been sealed away.

## Death blow
As they explored the remains of Ulthane's lair, the party reflected on the formidable foe they had just faced. Despite his menacing reputation, Ulthane had proven unprepared for the lightning assault that had caught him off guard, sealing his fate in a flurry of electric energy. It was Steward, grappling with the challenges of navigating a treacherous chasm, who turned his predicament into an unexpected advantage. In a moment of clarity amidst his frustration, he found himself in the perfect position to deal the killing blow to the notorious Doombringer of Hoare.

## Promising Lead
With Ulthane's defeat, the atmosphere shifted; the air felt charged with unfulfilled desires and lost ambitions. In the aftermath of the battle, the party discovered a collection of treasures: a dusty ledger filled with cryptic notes, a journal that hinted at the tormented past of its writer, and memories of a tongueless servant girl—forgotten and lost to time—who had once inhabited the body of Barricade. Her story rushed back into focus, a poignant reminder of the suffering that had taken place within the walls of the Yellowcrest Manor.

## Familiar little person
Among the treasures, Steward saw an opportunity in the shattered skull of Darkheart. Harnessing the essence of the demilich, he expertly used it to fuel the creation of a new homunculus, breathing life into the remnants of darkness and infusing his creation with arcane power. The air crackled with the energy of his work, marking a significant step in his journey as an artificer. What power might the creation receive from the fractured soul gem? Only time will tell. 

## Vengence
Yet, despite the allure of power offered by the Retribution of the Ancients, the party's motivations were deeper and more personal. The discovery of Ulthane's map, which marked the location of ancient ruins north of Leilon, revealed the residence of the foul rites associated with the tome. Fueled by a desire for justice, the party cared less about the book's power and more about the tangible opportunity to avenge the dead servant girl and the family she had once cared for. Their resolve hardened; they would confront the darkness that had claimed her life and ensure that such horrors would not befall anyone else.

## The Swords of Leilon
As word spread throughout Leilon, the townsfolk spoke of the party with reverence, referring to them as the Swords of Leilon, a namesake of former heroes who had once protected the realm. This newfound renown brought with it a sense of duty and expectation: would they live up to the legacy of those who came before them? With this in mind, the party set out toward the ruins, ready to face whatever dangers awaited them and to bring closure to the memories that haunted them.

## Base of Operations
Meanwhile, the disaffected fingerbones joined the employ of the troupe, committing to "fix up" the old Hornraven estate, in an effort to provide the heroes with a base of operations.

## Ulthane's journal 
> 7th Night of the Waning Moon, Year of Shadows
> 
> Viallis... His name festers in my mind, a persistent itch I cannot yet scratch. He hoards The Retribution of the Ancients, the very tome that calls to me from across the veil. It should be mine—the key to unlocking the true power of death itself. I can feel its dark whispers, like talons at the edge of my thoughts, urging me to claim it. And I will.
> 
> But for now, I have other tools at my disposal. The hags... repulsive creatures, yet useful in their own way. Their paintings—those grotesque works that imprison souls—are a marvel of dark magic. I care little for their artistry or their petty ambitions, but the energy those trapped souls provide is... exquisite. Each soul, twisted and bound within the canvas, fuels my necromancy. With the shattered skull of the demilich as my conduit, I have raised an army of the dead that grows stronger with each new soul I take.
>
> Even the Dreadscale Disciples are willing to pay for a piece of that power. Ungrix and his serpent-blooded sycophants crave an undead force to bolster their own twisted plans, though they are careful not to reveal the full extent of their schemes. I care not. The exchange benefits me, and that is all that matters. Their gold flows into my coffers, and in return, I sell them my undead—a fair trade, for now.
> 
> The Dreadscale Disciples believe they are clever, manipulating the hags for their own ends. Let them think so. Their plans to raise dracoliches with their “sacred horn” are of no consequence to me. They whisper in riddles and hide behind their snake-tongued ambitions, but it does not concern me. Let them have their dragons—I have the power of the ancient dead at my command. Their schemes are but distractions from the true prize.
> 
> As for Viallis, he has no idea how close I am to his precious lair. My spies move quietly, unraveling his hiding place. He believes himself untouchable, isolated in his ruin, clutching The Retribution of the Ancients like a miser hoarding gold. But once I have that book, I will tear his world apart. I will claim the power he so foolishly believes he can control, and I will show him what it truly means to bend the dead to one’s will.
> 
> The hags, the Disciples, the dragons—all of them are pawns, mere tools for my ascension. Only I, Ulthane, will stand at the pinnacle. My army grows with each soul taken, with each corpse I raise. Soon, Viallis will fall, and with The Retribution in my hands, I will have the power to reshape the world as I see fit.
> 
> I do not care for their ambitions. I care only for mine.
> 
> Soon.
> 
> —Ulthane

The party infiltrated the ruins to find foul creatures, spectators, beholder-kin whose bite was a large toothy maw with eyestalks that diminished them in various arcane ways. Yet, they defeated several disciples along with the floating eye beasts - and Lulu proceeded to drink from their fountain... 

What will happen next?!?!

# Session 26 - _Weald of Woe - Whispers by the Sea_
2024-11-07

The party followed the map to the Burnt Tongue temple, a ruin repurposed by Viallis and his followers to summon evils
from the Far Realm, using the rituals collected from various sources, including _Retribution of the Ancients_. After 
defeating several guards - Dreadscale Disciples and Burnt Tongue Cultists - along with Far Realm creatures, the party 
encountered a cultist who they captured and interrogated. They learned there was a ritual underway to summon more
creatures from the Far Realm, including Aylith, a mind flayer worshiped by the cult. 

The party moved further into the ruined temple to find a sanctuary, repurposed for dark means. Within, one victim had
already been sacrificed, and the entire chamber was bathed in an unholy purplish light. After slaying several of the 
cultists, including Viallis and Faerl, one of the surviving cultists slew the last victim, bringing Aylith from the
Far Realm to the sanctuary. 

The party defeated the rest of the cultists and narrowly escaped enslavement by Aylith, as Flanksteak had grappled 
him - giving Aylith too tempting of a prize to devour - Flanksteak's brain. Steward's uncanny ability to alter reality
saved Flanksteak from being the first to need the Revivify scroll and the enemies were defeated. 

The party then went down the sacrificial holes used to drop bones down to the lower level. There they encountered more
cultists and a grick, as well as several live hostages from Leilon and the surrounds.

After defeating the remaining cultists and securing the prisoners, they found a massive internment of nearly a hundred
victims, including Lady Maria and her children and the remains of Sarah, the ghost who had started this long ago...

Further investigation of the temple uncovered dark rights and rituals, along with a journal and some correspondence. 

## Viallis’ Journal, Entry #257
>"The disciples of Dreadscale grow more frantic with each passing day. Their wyrmspeaker, Ssyldrith, believes the ritual will be the pinnacle of their ambition—to transform Ungrix, the shadow-wreathed green dragon, into a dracolich of unspeakable power. But I know better. Dragons are such foolish creatures, clinging to the belief that undeath will grant them true dominion. Their Horn of Ascendancy is merely a relic of failed promises.
>
>Yet, Ungrix’s disciples move forward. They will initiate the first phase of the conversion ritual under the ruins in the Mere of Dead Men. The sacrifices are gathered, and once the horn calls to her, she will be bound to the will of the Dreadscale—no longer a dragon, but a puppet of their own making. It amuses me to no end.
>
>Still, I have my own purposes to tend to. These distractions are beneath me, yet I shall humor them a while longer. The mere thought of their desperation is... useful."
## Correspondence
>"Viallis,
>
>The horn is ready. I now wear the Jade amulet of Daurgothoth, and the preparations for Ungrix’s ascension near completion. We have gathered at the temple beneath the mere, and the final steps are soon to be taken. However, we require the remaining undead from your horde to ensure the ritual remains undisturbed. Time is short, and once the ascension begins, Ungrix will be unstoppable—her transformation from dragon to dracolich will mark the turning point in our rise to power.
>
>Make no mistake, once Ungrix becomes what she is destined to be, even your ambitions will be swallowed by her shadow."
>
>—Ssyldrith, Wyrmspeaker of Dreadscale"
Steward used his helm and keen mind, as well as Lulu's advice to discern the contents of a book with dragon claws. 
## Claugiyliamatar’s Bastard
>Ungrix was born as the result of a brief, almost dismissive dalliance by Claugiyliamatar with a lesser green dragon, a union she quickly disavowed. Despite Claugiyliamatar’s formidable status, she regarded her offspring with disdain, deeming Ungrix too weak and impulsive to be of any consequence or use to her grand designs. She never formally acknowledged her as her progeny, leaving Ungrix to grow up without the status or protection she might have otherwise enjoyed.
>
>Left to hatch in the forsaken depths of the Dead Mere, Ungrix’s egg lay hidden in shadowed, murky caverns, absorbing the eerie energies of the swamp. With no mother to guide her and only darkness as her companion, Ungrix’s young soul was infused with the malevolent shadows that permeated her birthplace.
>
>Abandoned by her mother and ostracized by other dragons who sensed her lowly status, Ungrix became consumed by a desire for power and independence, forging her own path through alliances with the disciples and shadow magic.

The party returned the remaining hostages to Leilon, along with the remains. 
- Kaelen Thorne - A seasoned ranger from the High Forest, known for guiding travelers safely through treacherous paths.
- Mira Voss - A Waterdhavian noble with a penchant for lost relics and ancient lore, rumored to have connections to the Harpers.
- Darrik Stonehelm - A rugged dwarven blacksmith from Baldur's Gate, famous for crafting enchanted blades that he only sells to those he deems worthy.
- Lyra Windrider - An enigmatic sorceress from Neverwinter with ties to elemental forces, often seen wandering the Mere of Dead Men in search of rare herbs and magical secrets.

> Sarah, Lady Maria and her children materialize before you, hugging each other. Sarah then speaks, “The shadows still coil in the swamp where the green scaled tyrant dwells, an ancient temple defiled by new masters,” then fades, her connection to the cult finally broken as their spirits finally leave the material, able to move on to their final rest. The spirits then vanish, their forms scattering like flower petals on the wind.

What will the party do next? It is not clear where this temple is, other than in the Mere of Dead Men, which is a very large swath of misty swamp. 

# Session 27 - _Weald of Woe_
2024-11-21

## Into the Mere
Returning to Leilon, our heroes—now celebrated as the new "Swords of Leilon"—were met with cheers and heartfelt gratitude. Among the crowd were families mourning the loss of loved ones, their grief tempered by relief as four freed captives returned alongside the remains of nearly 100 victims of the Burnt Tongue and their allies, the Dreadscale Disciples. The freed captives joined the community, aiding in funeral services, from digging graves to leading somber ceremonies.

Amid the somber proceedings, the party heard the captives' harrowing tales of abduction. During one funeral, an ethereal wisp appeared, lamenting it could not rest until it found Eritha, its wife, whose remains were absent among the recovered dead. The wisp’s sorrow drew our heroes’ attention back to the dark machinations of the Dreadscale Disciples, who they knew traded with hags and hoarbringers, supporting Sammaster’s Cult of the Dragon. These efforts, entwined with the "Sacred Horn," aimed to empower dragons into dracoliches, continuing Sammaster’s grim prophecy.

## Into the Mere: The Poisoned Path
Compelled by the wisp's plea, the party split—Flankstake and Valet, Steward's homunculus servant, followed the wisp into the Mere of Dead Men, while the others remained to gather information. Flankstake soon discovered an ominous scene: a dead horse, its foam-flecked body attracting a raven. As the raven flew off, he followed the trail to find 13 dead ravens, one partially eaten by its kin. Seeking evidence, Flankstake picked up the half-eaten raven but succumbed to its poisonous blood.

Valet continued alone while the rest of the party arrived just in time to save Flankstake from the poison’s lingering effects. Together, they pressed on, regaining contact with Valet as they stumbled upon a ruined church haunted by wisps. The spirits posed a riddle: "Who slew none, yet slew a dozen?" After one incorrect answer and a warning of dire consequences, the party realized the raven's poisoned death had caused the demise of its flock. Satisfied, the wisps allowed them to pass.

## Trials of the Fey
Deeper in the swamp, the party encountered a stone circle marked with seasonal symbols, guarded by mischievous fey. The fey launched volleys of tiny, poison-coated arrows, dropping Barricade and Steward into a deep sleep. Though the poison proved non-lethal, the attacks were unnerving. Thanks to Steward's Helm of Comprehend Languages, the cryptic taunts of the fey revealed a clue. The party correctly arranged the stones to represent the seasons, earning the fey's blessing to proceed.

## The Ritual’s Reckoning
The heroes reached their destination: the ruins of a forgotten temple, now overtaken by a yuan-ti cult. Inside, the cultists—pureblood dragonclaws, dragonfang malisons, and a dragonsoul nightmare wyrmspeaker—performed a dark ritual under the ominous glow of arcane energies. The episode ended in the heat of battle, with our heroes locked in a desperate fight against the cultists, the fate of the Mere and Eritha’s soul hanging in the balance.

## To Be Continued...
What dark secrets will the cult’s ritual reveal? Will the heroes triumph and uncover the truth behind Eritha's disappearance?

# Session 28 - _Weald of Woe_ 
2024-12-05

At the temple, the party found yuan-ti dreadscale disciples performing dark rituals. After defeating them and restoring statues to a fey god, they delved into the crypt below and faced more yuan-ti foes.

# Session 29 - _Weald of Woe_ 
2024-12-19

In the crypt, the party killed the wyrmspeaker yuan-ti abomination, but not before he spilled blood on a black crystal. Ungrix, a green shadow dragon, emerged, called by the wyrmspeaker's ritual, monologuing about her disdain for the disciples’ plan to use her body for a lich. A fierce battle followed, ending with Ungrix fleeing and cursing Leilon as she escaped.

Realizing they couldn't reach Leilon before Ungrix and her undead forces, they were aided by an ancient fey appearing as an elf boy, who teleported them ahead. The party joined the fey battalions preparing for war:

    Wildheart Tide: Mobile infantry.
    Willow's Thorn: Archers.
    The Wispborne: Infantry.
    Moon Riders: Flying cavalry.

Opposing forces include:

    Ungrix: Green shadow dragon.
    Fallen Legion: Skeleton and zombie infantry.
    Harrowmark: Skeletal archers.
    Soul Riders: Undead cavalry on nightmare steeds.

The session ended with preparations for a massive battle, pausing to strategize and review mass combat rules.

### A Night to Remember

The ball held in the grand Hall of Justice in Neverwinter was a celebration to honor the party's heroic deeds in defeating **Ungrix**, the great green shadow dragon, and her horde of undead that threatened Leilon. Nobles and high society gathered in force, creating a night of recognition and intrigue.  

The adventurers mingled with familiar faces and figures of significance, including:  
- **Zim**, a judge of Tyr, wearing vestments bearing symbols of scales balanced on a warhammer, the White Gauntlet and the Hammer and Anvil, accompanied by servitors each representing a virtue: hope, temperance, mercy, valor, devotion, and righteousness.  
- **Dagult Neverember**, accompanied by his daughter **Aurelia** and **Lucian**, an advisor who had heard of the party’s great deeds. Several nobles were seen discreetly vying for Lucian’s attention.  
- Patrons, past allies, and former captives freed by the party, their gratitude evident in their words and gestures.  

While the crew partook of the fine food and drink, especially Barricade, jesters, a string quartet and illusionists performing a light show provided entertainment. Steward, ever dutiful found a natural rhythym jointing the servants. 

The crew joined Dagult and Aurelia on the battlements to watch fireworks in honor of their triumphs. But instead of a dazzling display, the skies above the city darkened. A black orb appeared, enveloping Neverwinter and tearing it from its foundation. The city was wrenched across the **Astral Sea**, through the **Outer Torments**, and into the fiery skies of **Avernus**, the first layer of the Nine Hells.  

As events unfolded, Dagult made a lengthy and impassioned plea as the city’s new reality set in. 

### A Moment of Clarity
_As the chaos unfolds, a shaken Dagult Neverember, Lord Protector of Neverwinter, steps forward onto the battlements. His face is pale, his hands trembling. He looks at the you and speaks, his voice breaking but urgent:_

> "…this was not the plan. I—never the entire city! We must…you must defend it. The Hall, the Temple of Tyr—everything depends on you. Go, now!"

_Before the players can respond, a massive explosion rocks the battlements as a flaming chain pierces through the Hall of Justice below._

_Dagult begins barking orders from the battlements, musterning the Neverwinter Guard to bring nearby townsfolk into the Hall. He then turns toward you and hangs his head._

Allow the party to demand answers, but in any case, have Dagult try to explain. 

_Dagult runs a hand over his face, the weight of his decisions etched into his every movement. For a moment, he seems less like the Lord Protector of Neverwinter and more like a father burdened by guilt and desperation. His voice is low but steady, tinged with a rare vulnerability._

> “I owe you the truth. You’ve seen what’s happened—what I’ve done. My daughter, Aurelia, is my pride, my joy... and my greatest fear. Her mother, Selanna, was not like us. She was a celestial sentinel, bound to guard an artifact of unimaginable power: the Eternal Chain. That artifact kept infernal powers in check, held them at bay. But Selanna... she broke her vows. She fell in love with me, a mortal, and in doing so, left her post.”

_He pauses, his gaze flickering toward Aurelia, who stands silently nearby._ 
> “Because of her absence, a devil breached the sanctum. The Eternal Chain weakened, and infernal power began to seep into the world. Selanna was cast down, stripped of her celestial form, and our daughter—” he swallows hard—“Aurelia was marked, her soul cursed. The fiends claimed her as their own, a vessel to undo the Chain entirely.”

_He looks at each of you in turn, his eyes sharp yet weary._
> “I couldn’t allow that. I’ve spent years trying to protect her, searching for answers. An envoy of Asmodeus himself, Lucian, visited me three days ago and offered me a pact: Aurelia’s freedom, her soul untouched, in exchange for Castle Never and all its guests. I won’t justify my choice—I did what I thought was necessary.”

_Dagult’s voice hardens, but his hands tighten into fists._ 
> “I thought I could outwit them. I ordered Castle Never abandoned under the pretense of renovations, moving tonight’s celebration here, to the Hall of Justice. I believed the bargain would cost me the castle but spare the people. I was wrong. By altering the terms, I doomed us all. They didn’t just take Castle Never. They took the entire city.”

_He lets out a slow breath, visibly struggling to contain his emotions._ 
> “You deserved a celebration, a chance to rest after everything you’ve done. Instead, I’ve dragged you into my nightmare. But I swear, I will not let this city or its people fall. Not while I still draw breath.”

_He steps closer, his tone resolute now._ 
> “Aurelia’s celestial heritage may yet be our salvation. And with your strength, we might find a way to undo what I’ve set in motion. But for now, we fight to survive. And for that... I need you. This city needs you.”

As the players mull over Dagult's words, they hear screams from the Hall below. 

# Session 31 - _Fall of Neverwinter_ 
2025-01-16
### Flying Devils Attack!

_Descending the stairs in response to the terrified screams, the party emerged into a scene of utter chaos. The Halls of Justice, meant to serve as a sanctuary, had become a battlefield. Townsfolk who had sought refuge mingled with nobles and servants, all huddled behind makeshift defenses of overturned tables. Flying devils wielding chains and manacles swooped down, intent on capturing the souls of their prey—prized treasures in the infernal economy._

_Amidst the pandemonium, the party quickly dispatched the devils threatening their immediate vicinity, carving a path to safety for those in their care. Dagult Neverember, desperate and resolute, implored the group to retrieve the Rod of Veiled Stars from the hidden crypt below the Halls. With the Rod and Aurelia, the celestial ally, a powerful fortification could be activated to protect Neverwinter from the infernal assault._

### The Crypts
_The party ventured into the ancient tombs with Aurelia, navigating a labyrinth of crypts and vaults beneath the city. These hallowed halls honored the heroes and scholars of Neverwinter's storied past. Among the treasures they discovered were several tomes:_

- The Tome of Malharak: Chronicling Zariel’s rise and the fall of a celestial bastion.
- The Tome of Tiamat: Describing her chains at the gates of Dis and her manipulation of the Cult of the Dragon to expand her worship in Faerûn.
- The Tome of Brews: A collection of halfling brewing recipes and the history of a renowned family brewery.
- The Manual Automata: Detailed schematics matching Steward’s design, with hints of potential upgrades.
- The Glen’s Savior: A tale of a hero who saved the Verdant Glen, possibly linked to a modern-day champion.
- The Tome of the Iron Mantle: Recounting the story of the Heninga and how their trials gave rise to an unexpected hero.

_In the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where Lulu struggled with her inner, overwhelming desire for more yet left the well crafted greatsword at the soldier's side, and the Main Vault, Aurelia detected a ward, though it appeared inert for both the party and herself. Delving deeper into the Main Vault, they discovered a series of mist-shrouded tombs, each bearing cryptic messages. Through a combination of wit, skill, and fortune, the party chose the correct tomb, claiming the [Rod of Veiled Stars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9478179-rod-of-veiled-stars). Aurelia mentioned the fortification could be activated by activating the sanctuary with the staff in her presence while playing the pipe organ in the sanctuary accompanying the battlements._

_Steward and Flanksteak also discovered a unique fire, continual, like the others, but more... celestial, a spark of the [flame eternal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9583693-torch-of-the-eternal-flame) - the very secret fire rumored to be the source of creation. Steward lit two torches from this flame..._

_Before they could fully process their success, a thunderous crash shattered the silence. The sound of cracking stone reverberated through the crypt, followed by the unmistakable screams of those in peril above._

- **Tome of Malharak** 
  - _Malharak was a celestial bastion constructed on the edge of Hell's influence in the Outer Torments. It was an audacious move, a bold attempt to rescue mortal souls from Baator's clutches and disrupt its infernal designs. Under Valerian, a tome archon, and Elyssere, an astral solar, the angelic host claimed Malharak in a series of daring raids and fortified it into a fortress of divine light._
  - _For decades, Malharak stood as a symbol of celestial defiance, its prismatic spire repelling countless infernal sieges. But Asmodeus, the Archfiend of Hell, grew weary of the stalemate. He exploited the despair of Serabelos, a young astral deva who had seen her lover, Uriel, bound to Hell's service. Promising to free Uriel and spare any celestials who surrendered, Asmodeus made a pact with Serabelos,  betraying the fortress's sanctum, where its divine wards were anchored._
  - _When the wards fell, Malharak's defenses crumbled. Celestials fell in droves, unable to escape the proximity of Baator, unwilling to surrender, and their spirits were twisted into infernal forms. Though Valerian eventually brokered a desperate truce, surrendering the fortress, the victory was pyrrhic. Serabelos, consumed by guilt, took Uriel's place in Hell's armies, and Malharak became a hollow ruin, a grim reminder of celestial folly and infernal cunning, the fire from it's spire quenched. No longer would the prismatic spire weaken Hell._
  - _Serabelos' zeal made her quickly become Asmodeus' favorite, elevating her to archdevil of Avernus, where she takes on her Baator-name, Zariel._
- **Tome of Tiamat**
  - _Tiamat, the great five headed dragon, once ruled Avernus as guardian of the gates to the lower levels of Baator. Tiamat failed her charge to guard the gates of Dis and demon hordes spilled into the second circle of Hell. For her transgressions, she was bound in chains to the gates of Dis and became a ward of the gates, her influence in Hell diminished._
  - _Meanwhile, her power as deity was waning, with limited worshippers in the Realms. She schemed and manipulated a powerful cult, the Cult of the Dragon, manipulating Severin, their new leader, supplanting the teachings of Sammaster and his purpose of ascending dracoliches with the worship of living dragons, and ultimately her. Yet, she is still chained to the gates of Dis, limiting her ability to influence the Realms._
  - _Tiamat seeks to bring the spire to her temple, hoping it will break the chains that bind her. She believes she may use fires from the Gates of Dis as a spark to relight the spire._
- **Tome of Brews**
  - _This weathered tome is bound in leather and smells faintly of hops and honey and contains many ancient recipes for ales. Notably, one is rumored to have origins from a famous halfing family brewery and is notable for it's fruity hop character and creamy mouthfeel._
  - If brewed, this ale provides a temporary hit point bonus equal to twice the drinker's proficiency bonus until their next short or long rest.
- **Manual Automata**
  - _This battered manual is partially burned at the edges, and several pages have been meticulously ripped out, leaving the identity of its author unknown. It describes ancient knowledge of a prototype of an automata. The schematics reveal a design precisely as one that Steward was built after._
  - After reading the tome during a long rest, two upgrades are available.
    - +5 ft to speed
    - Darkvision of 60' or a +30 ft enchancement to existing darkvision.
- **The Glen's Savior**
  - _This book tells the story of an archfey, Nyxalith the Thornkeeper and his enslavement of the forest folk of the Glen. He would turn those that resisted his will into thorny statues, eternal warnings to others. One fateful day, Lucielle - Thornbreaker, wandered to the Glen, drawn by the suffering whispers within. She discovered the briarheart, the source of Nyxalith's power, and with a dagger enchanted by Selune, shattered the briarheart, freeing the Glen. It is rumored standing stones remain to this day in honor of her bravery and compassion, and that her spririt lives on in the life of a modern hero._ 
- **Tome of the Iron Mantle**
  - _This ancient, leather-bound tome, titled The Ravages of the Iron Mantle, details the Heninga’s cyclical rise as a barbarian horde uniting under the power of the fabled Iron Mantle. Found in the Hall of Scholars, its pages are marked by stories of conquest and destruction._
  - _The Heninga are a force born of chaos, uniting orcs, half-orcs, and humans beneath the Iron Mantle’s command. The mantle, a relic of great power, bestows visions of conquest to its bearer and compels obedience among rivals._
  - _In the Year of the Barren Elms, the Heninga marched from the Spine of the World, bypassing Citadel Adbar and Mirabar, and turned west. Their path of destruction reached the edge of the Evermoors before descending south._
  - _The Fall of Conyberry was swift and brutal. Fires consumed its fields and homes, and the town’s people were left shattered. Survivors spoke of a lone woman who fled to Phandalin, bearing a heavy burden—a child of uncertain parentage, taken from her arms to protect her and the town from the shadow of the Heninga’s legacy._

### Lulu's Journal
_Well, I guess I should have seen it coming.  But I didn’t. No apprehension, no caution, no worries.  My father would be SO disappointed._

_We finally routed out the pesky cultists, got to the heart of the matter – the actual dragon – and dispatched her and her undead army.  I regret the death of so many fey who committed whole heartedly to the battle.  But I did enjoy seeing Telarion again, and I gotta say, riding a dragon mount into battle was almost a dream come true._

_We rode back into Leilon on quite a high, “the Swords of Leilon” saved the town.  We received the invitation to the gala in our honor almost immediately.  Hardly time to check in at the Manor.  Note to self, we really need to rename it – Swords’ Manor perhaps?  I was so upbeat about our victory and the coming celebration that I almost left all my weapons behind.  Again, Father would have “tut-tutted” and shaken his head in disapproval.  Glad I didn’t do that though._

_Everything was so amazing in Neverwinter.  What a shindig!  So many of our friends we made during our adventuring before and even into Leilon were there.  Alice even brought Ava with her – she’s gotten so big!  Meeting Dagult Neverember and his daughter, Aurelia, left me with unease - my first warning that all was not right with the world.  Sure enough, the fireworks display was interrupted by the rending of the earth and the removal of all Neverwinter to the plane of Avernus, hell itself.  Buildings, people, the very ground uprooted and transported._

_All because of a deal Lord Neverember made with the devil.  He tried to trick Asmodeus and his envoy Lucien, but that never works.  So here we all are.  Neverember’s guards and the lords of the Triad try to keep the townspeople safe while we head below to secure the relic that will activate the safeguards against infernal incursion.  Aurelia, is the key.  But she is swarmed by the infernals.  This greatly bothers me.  Why are they so attracted to her?_

_Side note – Flankstake wanders by himself a lot.  Like, A LOT.  (So do I, but I call it scouting.)  Anyway, this time it paid off BIG.  In the levels below the Hall of Justice, Flankstake found a cache of tomes (in the crypts of the learned).  He’s got several of them, we’ll have to study them in more detail when we have time.  Steward was so excited in just the few minutes we spent looking them over that I thought he was going to explode.  His normal low-toned whirring and ticking noises got really loud._

_Side side note – I nearly did something stupid.  In the vault we came upon the crypt of The Unknown Hero.  Sticking to my resolve to be a bit more reckless like Barricade, I almost stole her sword.  I couldn’t even use it; it was SO big.  But thankfully, my other goal, to be more like Eg, kicked in and I stopped myself, honored the fallen hero and asked forgiveness._

_I miss Eg.  But today, I’m kind of glad he’s not here.  What a mess.  And it helps to know he’s out there in the material plane doing his thing, hopefully safe and sound._

## Chaos in the Crypts & the Celestial Fortification
_Fresh from securing the Rod of Veiled Stars, the party barely had a moment to celebrate before a thunderous crash shook the crypts. The sound of splitting stone and panicked screams confirmed their fears—the battle above had spilled into the depths._

_Rushing into action, the party corralled the fleeing townsfolk toward the main crypt, shielding them from a baatezu hunting party. Spinagons swarmed ahead, while a ruthless cornugon captain led the charge, brandishing infernal chains, intent on enslaving the survivors._

_In the desperate fight, Aurelia transformed into a giant elk, trampling through the enemy ranks but suffering a grievous infernal wound from the cornugon’s cruel weapon. With sheer determination, the party slaughtered the devils, tending to Aurelia’s wounds before fully healing her in the sacred pool of the main vault._

_From there, you battled through the chaotic main hall, ascending the battered fortress to reach the upper battlements, where you needed to complete the celestial fortification ritual. But before you could succeed, Lucian returned, flanked by a pack of shadowy wolves, intent on stopping the party and upholding his dark bargain._

_The party struck him down, wielding the Torch of the Eternal Flame to banish his darkness for good, ensuring that this time, Lucian would not return._

_Now, with the ritual before them and the fortress teetering on the edge of ruin, the final steps remain. Will the celestial fortification be enough to turn the tide?_

# Session 33 - _Across the Wastes of Avernus_
2025-02-20

_The party successfully activated the Celestial Fortification, repelling the devils assaulting Neverwinter, though the city remains chained to the Blood Rift. Dagult and Aurelia inform them that the Prismatic Spire of Malharak might be the key to breaking the chains, but it requires the Flame Eternal—a fragment of creation’s fire—currently sealed within Tiamat’s temple._

_[The Rod of Veiled Stars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9478179-rod-of-veiled-stars), 
the [Torch of the Eternal Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9583693-torch-of-the-eternal-flame) and the 
[Staff of Translocation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9478114-staff-of-translocation) act as 
keys to traversing Avernus and breaching the temple, but the road is perilous. Meanwhile, Zim provides an amulet linked to a celestial mark on a fleeing dragonborn acolyte, allowing the party to track them to the temple._

## Scenes Played:
- **The Battlefield Beyond the Rise** – _The party encountered a battle between baatezu and tanar’ri, finding a captive deva whose divine energy was being used to fuel infernal sorcerers. They chose to free her._
- **The Outcasts’ Refuge** – _A pit fiend and barbazu squad were trying to enter a dungeon below a ruined fortress, but a radiant rift warded the entrance. The party delved into the dungeon, retrieving items but failing to open a massive stone door until Steward cast Reduce on it. They retrieved the pit fiend’s banner. Perhaps this will restore balance from their previous engagement..._
## Next Steps:
The party must return the banner and continue toward Tiamat’s temple to retrieve the Flame Eternal before she can claim it for herself.

# Session 34 - _Across the Wastes of Avernus_
2025-03-06

_After returning Zarximor's banner, the exiled general and his outcasts pledged to rejoin the eternal conflict of the Blood War. While it remains to be seen how this will impact Avernus, one thing is certain—Zarximor and his warriors are no longer bound to aimless exile._

_Pressing onward, the party encountered an **infernal tempest**, a violent storm of hellish winds and searing energy. Amidst the chaos, the monk braved the storm and emerged with something unusual—an **angel’s heart**, its purpose and power still unknown. For now, it rests safely in the **Bag of Holding**._  

_Your next challenge came in the form of the **Nihilists**—a zealous cult devoted to bringing demons into Avernus. The party had a chance to disrupt their dark ritual but missed the moment, allowing two **Balguras** to emerge. The battle was brutal, not just due to the demons but also because of the cultists' chaotic nature. In the madness, they turned on each other, even transforming some of their own into **ghasts**._

_After a grueling fight, the party prevailed. Wounded and drained, they made the decision to **rest** before continuing deeper into the horrors of Avernus._

# Session 35 - _Across the Wastes of Avernus_
2025-03-20
## Aasimon Insurrection
_In the molten depths of the Infernal battlefield, your arrival turned the tide of a desperate struggle. Celestial warriors, their armor dulled and wings battered, fought with grim determination against devils commanded by Vexthar, "The Shackler," and Zirathris, "The Whispering Chains." Amidst clashing steel and burning stone, Commander Vaelios, "Shield of the Righteous," spotted you and called out:_
> "You are not devils. Then perhaps you are salvation."

_Together, you defeated the kytons and their allies, breaking the chains that enslaved the angels. As the battle fell to silence, the three surviving aasimon—Vaelios, Seraphaine, "Flame of the Heavens," and Myrielle, "Divine Light"—collapsed, their celestial light flickering._

_Vaelios, his voice hoarse but determined, revealed the truth: "This is our one chance. The contract is inside—the last shackle that binds us to the Pit." He gestured toward a jagged chasm exuding infernal magic, a place the angels could not enter. A barrier prevented them from crossing, leaving the task in your hands. You entered the fissure._

### Phase 2 - The Dungeon: Sanctum of the Bound
_Having entered the infernal chasm, you pressed forward through sweltering darkness. Cavern walls scarred with molten fissures loomed around them, and pits of bubbling lava dotted the floor. The air was thick with sulfur and something far worse._

_You soon encountered Sytheris the Oathbound, an erinyes whose once-radiant armor was now blackened and inscribed with infernal script. Her wings, twisted into crimson razors, marked her as something far removed from the celestial warrior she once was._
> "I heard your bargain," she sneered. "Vaelios always was the sentimental one."

_A brutish orthon lumbered behind her, its armored bulk radiating fiendish power. Its massive crossbow crackled with energy, marking it as a formidable opponent._

> "Run, mortals," Sytheris taunted. "Or become the next signatures in the contract."

_The battle was brutal. Lulu’s arrows struck true, forcing Sytheris to abandon her tactic of flying out over the lava and confront the party in melee. Meanwhile, Barricade, in the wildshape of an owlbear, tore into the orthon, ultimately delivering a devastating strike that shattered the stone anchoring the infernal contract on this side of the pit. The critical blow disrupted the binding magic, breaking the sigil’s power._

_Believing Sytheris might now be freed from her chains, Steward attempted to reason with her. But her betrayal was long past, her loyalty to the Nine Hells a cold, merciless truth. Redemption was not hers to seek._
